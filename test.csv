0,The Son of New York Who Runs the South’s Most Envied Sports League,"Greg Sankey rose from upstate New York to become the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference. These days, no one is exercising more sway over college sports.","Dec. 31, 2021","Steve Spurrier was coming back to college football as South Carolina's new coach when he met Greg Sankey for the first time.Where, Spurrier demanded of Sankey in 2004, did you go to college? Sankey, then a Southeastern Conference associate commissioner, assured Spurrier that his degrees were from Cortland State and Syracuse, leaving him free of the partisanship that defines Southern college football.Sankey recalled that Spurrier, irrepressible as ever, replied: “That’s what we need: a bunch of people in that conference office who don’t care who wins or who loses.”But Sankey cared very much about winning in other ways. Sankey, installed as the SEC commissioner in 2015, has become one of the foremost gatekeepers to the future of college sports, with influence widely seen as surpassing that of the N.C.A.A. president or any other Power 5 conference leader.He ushered Oklahoma and Texas through SEC membership talks. He is helping lead a committee that will spend the coming months weighing new rules for Division I, the N.C.A.A.’s wealthiest and most prominent tier. He is an architect of a potential College Football Playoff expansion that could make it the most valuable event in intercollegiate athletics. On Friday, his league will have teams in both playoff semifinal games: top-ranked Alabama in the Cotton Bowl, and No. 3 Georgia in the Orange Bowl.Sankey, 57, has prompted comparisons to Mike Slive, who built the SEC into college football’s premier league, and Jim Delany, who dominated the Big Ten Conference for decades.“Greg Sankey is Jim Delany 2.0,” said Patty Viverito, the longtime commissioner of the Missouri Valley Football Conference and, along with Sankey, a member of an influential N.C.A.A. policymaking body. “They’re both brilliant. They can both be formidable to the point of ruthless. They’re fearless. They probably know more than anybody else in any room that they occupy at any level because of their longevity and intelligence. They’re both problem solvers in a practical way.”But the lingering question, and sometimes the worry, for many college sports executives is how the SEC-centric Sankey will use his swelling influence at a time when their shared industry is under siege. College sports’ wealth gap is widening, players are enjoying the freedom to earn money, which the N.C.A.A. barred for generations, and politicians and the courts are looking askance at a system routinely condemned as exploitative.Interviews with more than two dozen people show a commissioner who has long relied on an often unflinching style to advance the SEC’s ambitions. But Sankey, who recently agreed to a contract that will keep him at the league’s helm until at least 2026, has spent much of his career in the shadows, a figure central to plenty of big decisions but so measured that few people can remember the finer points of his presentations.The most detailed interaction that Burke Magnus, a top ESPN executive, could recall was when Sankey, aghast at a television maven’s note-taking habits, transformed into an apostle for Colonel Littleton legal pads.“I’ve never heard him raise his voice,” said Bill Hancock, the playoff’s executive director and a fixture of college sports for more than 40 years.“He’s more prone to nudging,” he added. “He won’t force anything. If he doesn’t have to talk, he won’t talk.”Sankey’s path to a Southern juggernaut started in upstate New York.He was a welder’s son and passionate enough about sports that his prize for winning a clean desk contest in sixth grade was a book by John Wooden, the U.C.L.A. men’s basketball coach. When Sankey enrolled at what was then LeTourneau College — drawn to the Christian school more by its presence in Texas, he said, than religion — he majored in electrical engineering while he played on the baseball team. (His coach remembered him as a gangly catcher with a good arm.)Sankey has often said that a conversation with his coach after he sulked during a game in his freshman year had imparted lasting lessons and stirred his interest in working in college sports. In a November interview, he said that summertime work at a New York nuclear plant and 4 p.m. labs as a freshman had also been formative.“Loverboy had a song at that point, ‘Working for the Weekend,’” Sankey said. “I didn’t want to spend my life five days of the week longing for the weekend.”“Ironically,” he added, “I don’t have weekends any longer.”Around the time he finished his undergraduate degree, he saw a classified advertisement: Utica College was looking for an intramural sports director. The pay was $15,000 a year, plus remitted tuition at Syracuse. He took the gig. At one point, he said, he bought his own copy of the N.C.A.A.’s rules manual.His wedding date during his Utica days, he maintains, is evidence that had no ambitions to run the SEC since he got married during football season.He soon earned an internship at Northwestern State in Natchitoches, La., where he quickly became the golf coach, too. With the school mired in a basketball scandal, it was only months before the athletic director hired him in 1990 to oversee rules compliance.He moved to the Southland Conference in 1992, became the commissioner four years later and drove a Honda around Louisiana and Texas to visit schools so overlooked that they paid television networks to air their football games. In 1997, exhausted and living on lattes at 32, he collapsed in an airport bathroom with an irregular heartbeat.About five years later, Slive realized he needed a mop-up man at the SEC, which was bedeviled by rules violations. He brought in Sankey to deliver even-toned admonitions to help athletes, coaches and administrators decipher the rules.“He wants to be helpful, but if you screwed up, you were going to be accountable for that,” said Greg McGarity, who was then a top official at Florida and later spent a decade as Georgia’s athletic director. “He was not a get-out-of-jail-free-type person. If you violated rules, especially intentionally, he had no patience for that.”The SEC’s leaders had set a meeting in 2015 to pick Slive’s successor. And although Daniel Jones, who was then Mississippi’s chancellor, had been gravely sick for months, he resolved to be there. He wanted Sankey.“I, a committed anti-charismatic guy, saw an impressive, committed anti-charismatic guy, and I thought he’d be just right,” Jones said.Other SEC chiefs were making similar calculations. David Gearhart, who was the Arkansas chancellor, said Sankey was “not the flashy type, but that’s what we liked about him.”Their vote was unanimous.In his second year as commissioner, Sankey faced the kind of situation that, at the time, counted as a crisis. Hurricane Matthew had forced the cancellation of Louisiana State’s game at Florida and fueled a spat between two of the league’s powerhouses and their players. (An L.S.U. linebacker, for instance, accused the Gators of being “scared” to play in Baton Rouge.)Neither school was particularly pleased with the outcome that Sankey helped devise: The universities combined to spend $2 million to cancel nonconference games so they could play each other later, and policy changes gave the SEC more power for similar situations in the future.“A lot of people at that point were really wondering if he was going to be able to overcome it,” said Paul Finebaum, who has covered the SEC for decades, now as an ESPN host. “I thought it was a critical moment where it could have gone two different ways. He played it very cautiously, and he may have lost a headline short-term, but, ultimately, he didn’t make a grievous error.”Sankey — long compared to a cryptic, strategic player of poker or chess, but interested in neither — had grown accustomed to scrutiny by then. He had a seat on an N.C.A.A. infractions committee and had been sorting through complicated rules violations. In 2011, he was a member of the panel that handed Ohio State football a one-year postseason ban.“He’s focused on accurate information, and he’s focused on seeking the truth,” said Dennis Thomas, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference’s commissioner and the chairman of the committee that reviewed the Ohio State matter. “But he’s also understanding of the campus environment.”Six years later, Sankey chaired the committee tasked with sorting out the repercussions of academic fraud at North Carolina. Some around North Carolina argued that Sankey would try to kneecap the school, an Atlantic Coast Conference member, to help the SEC.It was one of the few times, colleagues said, he seemed perturbed by the noise around college sports.“It wounded him,” said Eleanor Myers, a Temple law professor who was on the committee. “He was really hurt by the criticism that somehow he was going to use that position to advance the competitiveness of the SEC over the A.C.C., and that hurt him deeply because he is such a moral person. He was furious.”The panel eventually concluded that North Carolina had not broken N.C.A.A. rules, unsavory as it believed the scandal had been.The decision gave the college sports industry’s critics fresh fodder and made new skeptics of the system, too. The rules, plenty of them argued, offered escape hatches for wrongdoers in an industry that often defended itself with soaring language about integrity and a balance between academics and athletics.The North Carolina decision was only part of a multiyear reckoning for the N.C.A.A.Misgivings about the industry’s economic model, which had relied for generations on unpaid athletes to help earn billions of dollars, resonated more broadly, with terms like “wage theft” uttered on Capitol Hill and Twitter alike. The N.C.A.A. faced criticism for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, its mismanagement of women’s sports and its slow pace on just about everything.Fed up with everything from the secrecy surrounding the N.C.A.A.’s governing board to the debacle over substandard facilities at the 2021 women’s basketball tournament, Sankey started taking longtime private frustrations public more often, his warnings loaded with the imprimatur of some of college sports’ biggest powers.“Do I believe there’s value in a national entity?” Sankey said. “Absolutely, but I believe it has to be reconsidered across the board.”To some executives, Sankey’s carefully worded critiques have signified a restiveness among Power 5 schools that could someday splinter the N.C.A.A.So in what many industry officials interpreted as an effort to keep Sankey somewhat on board, association leaders asked him to help preside over a committee to brainstorm new ideas for Division I, the latest step in the N.C.A.A.’s quest to remain relevant. Sankey insists he does not know what the panel’s work will yield, adding that he had “thoughts” but also “a responsibility in leading to engage and collaborate.”“We have some real big issues to deal with,” said Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A. president. “Greg’s just talked about them directly and said what’s on a lot of people’s minds.”Or, as Viverito put it, “I think Emmert and Co. were smart enough to know they weren’t going to get anything done unless they had him at the table.”Emmert and other executives attributed part of Sankey’s rising outspokenness to an increasing comfort with his stature as the SEC commissioner.The role has long been important. But the league’s ascendance has accelerated recently.The conference will soon shed one of the worst television deals in sports, a Slive-era agreement with CBS that undervalued SEC football at about $55 million a year. In its place, Sankey helped broker a contract with ESPN that, when it was signed last year, was poised to be worth about $3 billion over a decade.The SEC, Magnus said, had negotiated a clause unique among ESPN’s college sports contracts: a formula for the deal’s value to rise automatically if the league added members.The SEC and ESPN had largely hammered out their arrangement, which will become far cozier in the years ahead, before the virus stunned the world. The public health crisis gave Sankey a platform few commissioners had ever had. His paragraph-length sentences during interviews on Finebaum’s program shaped the national outlook for college sports.“With each conversation, he got stronger and more confident and his message began to be heard, and his message was very simple: Let’s be patient,” Finebaum said.August 2020, Finebaum believes, was a turning point for Sankey, who kept the SEC pressing ahead with its plans for a football season even after the Big Ten and Pac-12 announced that they would not play that autumn, decisions they ultimately reversed.“That’s when he went from being a methodical, plodding leader of a well-respected conference to being the man who saved college football,” Finebaum said.College football stumbled through the 2020 season. Acrimony then erupted in July, when Oklahoma and Texas made plans to leave the Big 12. (The Big 12 commissioner, Bob Bowlsby, declined to comment for this article.)After word of the potential additions emerged, Sankey opened a series of conversations with Ross Bjork, the Texas A&M athletic director who did not like the prospect of another school from his state joining the SEC.“He talked us through it, not that he had to persuade anything from our standpoint because we understood the bigger picture,” said Bjork, whose school still spent some time on a public relations rampage.But Sankey, long known for keeping in close touch with his allies and employers, and others worked quietly to mollify the Aggies. There were no public threats.A&M voted days later to admit Texas, assuring that the league’s clause with ESPN would yield a mightier sum for the SEC. All around college sports, one college after another looked for new leagues and better deals as criticism rained down on Sankey for keeping quiet his dalliances with the Big 12’s most famous schools, even in his regular conversations with Bowlsby.Sankey appeared unbothered.Before almost anyone had known what was afoot, he had gotten what he and the SEC wanted."
1,"With Exasperation, College Football Is Just Trying to Get Through the Playoff",Frustrations with the pandemic in college sports have mirrored the challenges seen well beyond athletics.,"Dec. 30, 2021","In this malleable, ebb-and-flow pandemic world, there may be one certainty gleaned from the last nearly two years of living with the coronavirus: that here and there may not look very much alike.When New York City was all sirens, silence and grim isolation during the first wave of the pandemic, it was easy for someone in, say, Medicine Lodge, Kan., to shrug and wonder what all the fuss was over this coronavirus — until a couple months later when it swept through the plains.It has continued since, this cresting and falling, with mask and vaccine mandates, new variants, and the uncomfortable and unrelenting dance for policymakers — who have been tugged one way by science (that quickly shifts) and another by a fitful business community (that may not always tend to its employees’ well being with the same vigor it tends to the bottom line).Sports have been no different.Its myth makers often promote sports as a better version of ourselves, long proclaiming the playing surface to be America’s true egalitarian workplace, where merit is supreme, which is true — as long as you weren’t a Black baseball player or quarterback, or openly gay, or a woman coach at the wrong times. In other words, it has been like many other workplaces.And so, as the latest wave — spurred by the Delta and Omicron variants — is spreading across the United States from east to west, leading to more than 300,000 new cases per day, more than doubling in the last two weeks, there has been no exemption for sports.The N.F.L., which moved three games earlier this month because of virus outbreaks, had 96 players test positive for the virus on Monday. Dozens of N.H.L. games have been postponed or canceled and the league paused activities last week. Seven of the N.B.A.’s 30 head coaches are unavailable for various virus-related reasons, with Philadelphia’s Doc Rivers and Denver’s Michael Malone, whose team’s game against Golden State was postponed, becoming sidelined on Thursday.In college sports, hundreds of men’s and women’s basketball games have been canceled or postponed, and many teams have played short-handed — like Seton Hall, whose men’s team missed six players Wednesday in a narrow loss to Providence. And seven football programs have bowed out of bowl games because of virus outbreaks within their teams. One of them, U.C.L.A., withdrew from the Holiday Bowl just hours before Tuesday’s scheduled kickoff.Most of the teams that could not play were overwhelmed quickly by outbreaks. Boston College had one player test positive just before it left for the Military Bowl in Annapolis, Md., on Dec. 22. He was left behind. By Dec. 25, more players had tested positive. There were more again on Sunday. With more than 40 players unavailable because of the virus, injuries, transfers and opt-outs, the school decided it could not safely play the game that had been scheduled for Monday.At Virginia, position meetings were moved to the indoor practice field, where the garage doors on two sides of the building can be rolled up to allow for better ventilation. Flat screens were mounted to walls, folding chairs were set up in groups and projectors were put in place. Still, a handful of positive tests last week prompted the entire team to be tested on Christmas Day. When the tests came back on Sunday morning, there enough positives that the team bowed out of the Fenway Bowl, which had been scheduled for Wednesday.An athletic trainer at a school that had to cancel its bowl game said one of his toughest tasks is explaining to athletes and coaches why guidelines keep changing, as they did this week when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shortened the window for isolation to five days from 10, and did not recommend a negative test to end the isolation, which has generated criticism from some scientists.“What we’re seeing is a lot of frustration and exhaustion,” said the trainer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he said the topic was too politically fraught. “It takes a lot of education and repeat education of where you’re at, over and over and over again. Sometimes they look at you like: ‘What are you talking about? Last month you told us something else.’”Then there is the crown jewel of the college football season, the four-team playoff that begins Friday with a pair of semifinals: No. 1 Alabama against No. 4 Cincinnati in the Cotton Bowl outside Dallas, and No. 2 Michigan versus No. 3 Georgia in the Orange Bowl near Miami.What’s going on with the virus in the rest of the country is a subject that few associated with the games would care to address. There have been a handful of cases to pop up — two with Alabama coaches, others with players for Georgia and Michigan — and the universities are not required to test vaccinated players, even as the Omicron variant has been successful in infecting vaccinated people. Perhaps there will be announcements on Friday of players who are unavailable, as there were last season.In truth, though, the two semifinal games and the Jan. 10 championship game in Indianapolis are too valuable to be waylaid by the virus. ESPN has paid the College Football Playoff about $470 million for the rights to this year’s games, according to The Associated Press.And the games have been protected as such. Practices have been closed to the news media since Tuesday — even the usual 15 minutes or so when camera crews collect footage of players stretching — so there will be no monitoring of whether anyone is missing, which might prompt questions about why. Media sessions were made remote and have been, shall we say, curated.In one of them on Wednesday, Alabama receiver Slade Bolden was asked if, with vaccines so prevalent, he thought we had been through the worst of the pandemic. “I mean, I never know when it’s actually going to end,” he said. “I hope it ends as soon as possible.”He was asked a follow-up question: When was the last time he’d been tested?“I honestly can’t tell you because we usually don’t get tested unless we have symptoms,” he said. (That is in keeping with N.C.A.A. guidelines, which have called for testing only for symptomatic players and unvaccinated players within 72 hours of kickoff.)That last exchange, though, was withheld from the transcripts that are distributed more widely to the news media, as was another about the virus with Cincinnati tight end Josh Whyle, who said he will have 25 family members traveling to the game.Scottie Rodgers, the spokesman for the Cotton Bowl, said all transcripts are edited “for accuracy and to make sure the quotes included provide substantive content.”Rodgers did not respond to a follow-up email asking what about coronavirus questions were not considered substantive content. There was, however, plenty of back-and-forth in the transcripts on the merits of the Cincinnati area’s distinctive chili."
2,"John Madden, Face and Voice of the N.F.L. on the Field and in the Broadcast Booth, Dies at 85",Mr. Madden coached the Oakland Raiders to a Super Bowl title before becoming one of football’s best-known broadcasters and a video game entrepreneur.,"Published Dec. 28, 2021","John Madden, the Hall of Fame coach who became one of America’s most recognizable ambassadors of professional football, reaching millions, and generations, from the broadcast booth and through the popular video game that bears his name, died on Tuesday. He was 85.The National Football League announced his death in a statement that didn’t include the cause. He died at his home in Pleasanton, Calif., his agent, Sandy Montag, said. In his irrepressible way, and with his distinctive voice, Madden left an imprint on the sport on par with titans like George Halas, Paul Brown and his coaching idol, Vince Lombardi. Madden’s influence, steeped in Everyman sensibilities and studded with wild gesticulations and paroxysms of onomatopoeia — wham! doink! whoosh! — made the N.F.L. more interesting, more relevant and more fun for over 40 years.“John Madden is as important as anybody in the history of football,” Al Michaels, his broadcast partner from 2002 through 2008 with ABC and NBC, said in an interview in 2013. “Tell me somebody who did all of the things that John did, and did them over this long a period of time.”Madden retired from coaching the Oakland Raiders in 1979, at age 42 and with a Super Bowl victory to his credit, but he turned the second act of his life into an encore, a Rabelaisian emissary sent from the corner bar to demystify the mysteries of football for the common fan and, in the process, revolutionize sports broadcasting.Rising to prominence in an era of football commentating that hewed mostly toward a conservative, fairly straightforward approach, Madden’s accessible parsing of X’s and O’s added nuance and depth, and also a degree of sophistication that delighted an audience that in some cases tuned in just for him.Fastidious in his preparation, Madden introduced what is now a standard exercise in the craft — observing practices, studying game film and interviewing coaches and players on Fridays and Saturdays. Come Sundays, he would distill that information into bursts of animated, cogent and often prescient analysis, diagraming plays with a Telestrator, an electronic stylus (whose scribbles and squiggles reflected its handler’s often rumpled appearance) that showed why which players went where.Madden spent his first 15 years in broadcasting at CBS, starting in 1979. There he introduced his Thanksgiving tradition of bestowing a turducken — a turkey stuffed with duck stuffed with chicken — to the winning team. But the three other major networks all came to employ him because, at one point or another, they all needed him.Fox snagged him in the mid-1990s to establish credibility for its fledgling sports division. ABC followed in 2002, to boost the sagging fortunes of “Monday Night Football.” NBC hired him when it regained football in 2006 — because, as Dick Ebersol, then the chairman of NBC Universal Sports, said: “He’s the best analyst in the history of sports. He’s able to cut through from people my age, who remembered him as a coach, all the way to 12-year-olds.”Madden received 16 Sports Emmy Awards, including 15 for top analyst.He parlayed his appeal into a series of career incarnations — commercial pitchman, successful author, video-game entrepreneur — and embraced them all with zest. He produced three New York Times best-sellers. He peddled “Boom! Tough Actin’” Tinactin as an athlete’s foot remedy and broke through reams of paper (and the odd door) in advertisements for Miller Lite. His Electronic Arts video game evolved into a cultural phenomenon with annual midnight releases and widespread tournaments after its inception in 1988, selling tens of millions of copies with revenue in the billions.At his core, though, Madden was a coach and by extension a teacher; as he proudly noted in interviews, he graduated with a master’s degree in physical education, a few credits short of a doctorate, from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. His unscripted manner translated as well in the Raiders’ locker room — where he guided a cast of self-styled outlaws and misfits to eight playoff appearances in 10 seasons as head coach — as it did in living rooms, man caves and bookstores.“He was who you saw on TV,” said Ted Hendricks, a Hall of Fame linebacker who played for Madden from 1975 through 1978. “He gave us freedom, but he always had complete control of his players.”As inclusive as he was beloved, Madden embodied a rare breed of sports personality. He could relate to the plumber in Pennsylvania or the custodian in Kentucky — or the cameramen on his broadcast crew — because he viewed himself, at bottom, as an ordinary guy who just happened to know a lot about football. Grounded by an incapacitating fear of flying, he met many of his fans while crisscrossing the country, first in Amtrak trains and then in his Madden Cruiser, a decked-out motor coach that was a rare luxurious concession for a man whose idea of a big night out, as detailed in his book “One Size Doesn’t Fit All” (1988), was wearing “a sweatsuit and sneakers to a real Mexican restaurant for nachos and a chile Colorado.”For more than 20 years, that bus shepherded Madden to and from his assignments, a fulfillment of sorts of a favorite book, “Travels with Charley,” by John Steinbeck, who had driven around America in a camper with his poodle. When Madden greeted family members and friends on the flight he had chartered for them to attend his induction ceremony at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, in August 2006, it was his first time in an airplane in 27 years.“When you pulled up somewhere in that bus, it was like Air Force One had arrived,” said Fred Gaudelli, who as Madden’s producer at ABC and NBC traveled with him for seven years. “It was amazing the way people would react to that thing.”If contemporaries like Bud Grant and Tom Landry epitomized the archetype of coach as sideline stoic, Madden served as their counterweight. He imparted an iconoclastic, demonstrative presence, one that echoed the spirit of the 1970s and the countercultural nexus of Northern California and that also suited his team of so-called renegades. The enduring image of Madden was of his oversize frame bounding onto the field, flouting the tenets of sideline decorum with arms flailing, mouth racing and red hair flopping against a pink face.Madden ditched the dress code and encouraged individual expression, tolerating his players’ penchant for wild nights and carousing because, he knew, they would always give him their full effort — especially on Sundays. Unlike the disciplinarians of his day, he imposed few rules, asking them only to listen, to be on time and to play hard when he demanded it. Madden told The New York Times in 1969 that “there has to be an honesty that you be yourself”; for him, that meant treating his players as “intelligent human beings.”Madden, at age 32, inherited a team in 1969 that had gone a combined 25-3 the previous two seasons, and he maintained the Raiders’ standard of excellence. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment was working as long as 12 years for Al Davis, the Raiders’ irascible and Machiavellian owner — and staying close friends with him until Davis’s death in 2011.But when Madden retired, having been pummeled by ulcers and panic attacks and what is now regarded as burnout, he could boast of a résumé that included a Super Bowl XI demolition of the Minnesota Vikings in 1977; a .759 regular-season winning percentage (103-32-7), best among coaches who have worked at least 100 games; and an on-field view of some of the most controversial and memorable moments in football history: the notorious “Heidi” game (1968), the Immaculate Reception (1972) and the infamous Holy Roller play in 1978, his final season.The thought of overseeing another minicamp, another round of draft preparation, bedeviled him. Lombardi coached for 10 years, and so would Madden.“You traveled around but you never saw anything,” Madden told The Washington Post in 1984. “Everything was an airplane, a bus, a hotel, a stadium, a bus, an airplane and back home. One day I said, ‘There has to be more to life than this.’”Bam!And there was.John Earl Madden was born in Austin, Minn., on April 10, 1936, the oldest of three children, and the only son, of Earl and Mary (Flaherty) Madden. His father was a mechanic.When John was 6, his family moved to Daly City, Calif., a working-class suburb of San Francisco whose proximity to the city offered adventurous escapes for sports-crazed boys. With his close friend John Robinson, who would become the head coach at Southern California and of the Los Angeles Rams, Madden hitched trolley rides into town and then sneaked into Kezar Stadium and Seals Stadium to watch football and baseball games.His family was of modest means, but Madden was resourceful. He scrounged for gear in rummage bins and fashioned his baseball bats by taping together pieces found at semipro games. Opportunities for minor-league baseball beckoned — the Red Sox and the Yankees expressed interest — but Madden, from his time caddying for the well-heeled at the San Francisco Golf Club, had come to equate success with a college education.He book-ended an unfulfilling year at the University of Oregon with stays at two community colleges, the College of San Mateo in California and Grays Harbor College in Aberdeen, Wash., before transferring to Cal Poly, where he would meet his future wife, Virginia Fields. There his prowess on the offensive line attracted the Philadelphia Eagles, who selected him in the 21st round of the 1958 draft.Madden never played for the Eagles; a serious knee injury quashed his pro prospects. But while rehabilitating in Philadelphia he began transitioning to the next phase of his life. Reviewing game film with the Hall of Fame quarterback Norm Van Brocklin, Madden was encouraged to start thinking like a coach. He pursued that calling back in California, where he worked for four years at Allan Hancock College, two as head coach, and for three years at San Diego State, as an assistant.It was at San Diego, in November 1966, that Madden first encountered Davis, a meeting that would change the course of football history. For an hour they talked strategy and schemes. Only much later — long after Davis had hired him in 1967 to oversee the Raiders’ linebackers and then promoted him to head coach two years later — did Madden realize that he had in effect sat for an interview.Their relationship was complicated. At times it was fraught with tension and pressure, with Madden navigating the whims of his demanding boss while combating the perception that Davis, not he, deserved credit for the team’s success. But Davis valued Madden’s ability to manage his players’ diverse personalities and mold them into a cohesive — and winning — team. In 2006, Davis introduced Madden at the Hall of Fame.It seems difficult to imagine, but when Madden first experimented with broadcasting to satisfy his football cravings, he was stiff and uncertain, far from the polished professional who would set the standard for future analysts; reacting to his popularity, networks searched for the next Madden. He expected members of his production team to know their football, and if they did not, he was known to glance at the heavens and apologize to Lombardi and Halas for the indiscretion.At CBS and Fox, his frenetic style meshed smoothly with the minimalism of Pat Summerall, his broadcast partner of 21 years. Al Michaels later complemented him in a different way, with an opinionated style, though not overbearingly so, and a knack for leading Madden into stimulating discussions. Working with Madden, Michaels said, was like “singing a song, and we had the musical notes in front of us. Away we went.”Their last game together was Super Bowl XLIII, in February 2009. Two months later, Madden left the broadcast booth, citing a desire to spend more time with his family.Madden and his wife had two sons, Joseph and Michael, and a number of grandchildren. Complete information on his survivors was not immediately available.Even in retirement, Madden remained active in football, serving as a consultant to the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, and on committees for player safety and competition.For all of his celebrity, Madden was perhaps most closely identified with his video game franchise, which connected him to younger generations. He was fond of saying that when many younger people met him, it became apparent to him that they knew him from the video game, not as a Hall of Fame coach or perhaps even as an innovative broadcaster. Not that he was complaining, necessarily: He had fulfilled his father’s wishes.“Once you start work, you’re going to have to work the rest of your life,” Madden said, recounting Earl’s advice, in his 2006 induction speech at the Hall of Fame. Then he added: “I have never worked a day in my life. I went from player to coach to a broadcaster, and I am the luckiest guy in the world.”"
3,"Dave Draper, Bodybuilding’s ‘Blond Bomber,’ Dies at 79","After being named Mr. America, Mr. Universe and Mr. World, he left competitive bodybuilding in 1970. But he kept lifting weights until a year before he died.","Dec. 24, 2021","Dave Draper, a popular bodybuilder of the 1960s who won three major titles before dropping out of competition at age 28, died on Nov. 30 at his home in Aptos, Calif., near Santa Cruz. He was 79.The cause was congestive heart failure, his wife, Laree Draper, said.Mr. Draper — who stood six feet tall, had a 54-inch chest and competed at 235 pounds — emerged as a force in bodybuilding in 1962 with his victory at the Mr. New Jersey competition. He soon moved to Southern California, where he continued to sculpt his body at the Dungeon, a gym on the fabled Muscle Beach in Santa Monica, and at Gold’s Gym, in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles.He loved lifting weights for its physical and spiritual benefits. But he disliked the preening and posing required of bodybuilders at competitions and exhibitions.“For a reasonable season of my life, it seemed like the thing to do,” Mr. Draper said in an interview in 2009 with T-Nation, a strength training and bodybuilding website. “But competition stood between me and the relief of hoisting the iron — the private exertion, the pure delight and the daily fulfillment of building muscle and strength.”Despite that ambivalence, Mr. Draper, who became known as the Blond Bomber, was a star on the bodybuilding scene of the 1960s. He was named Mr. America in 1965, and Mr. Universe in 1966 — before Arnold Schwarzenegger had arrived from Austria — and won the Mr. World title in 1970.“Dave trained harder than anybody else and always wore jeans to the gym,” Frank Zane, a three-time Mr. Olympia, said in a phone interview. “He loved to train, and he was very strong. He just didn’t like competing.”Mr. Draper’s spectacular physique found an occasional home in Hollywood. He had roles in sitcoms like “The Beverly Hillbillies” (as Dave Universe, a date for Elly May Clampett) and “The Monkees” (as a character named Bulk). He was also in a few films, including “Don’t Make Waves” (1967), in which he played Sharon Tate’s boyfriend.“In Austria, I kept his cover of Muscle Builder magazine on the wall above my bed for motivation,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said in a statement after Mr. Draper’s death, “and when I saw him starring in ‘Don’t Make Waves,’ I thought, ‘My dreams are possible.’”Mr. Draper, who was also a skilled woodworker, became one of Mr. Schwarzenegger’s training partners and built some furniture for his home in Santa Monica. “I learned his heart was as big as his pecs,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said.Even as he was competing, Mr. Draper was abusing alcohol, marijuana and angel dust. (He said he also used steroids, sparingly, under a doctor’s supervision.) He continued to have problems, chiefly with alcohol, until 1983, when he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure.Ms. Draper — who met her future husband at a gym in Capitola, Calif., near Santa Cruz — attributed his alcohol and drug use to the tensions brought on by competing and dealing with the demands of Hollywood.“He got caught up in it, and I guess he couldn’t handle it,” she said in an interview.David Paul Draper was born on April 16, 1942, in Secaucus, N.J. His father, Dan, was a salesman; his mother, Anne (Simsek) Draper, was a homemaker.Dave, who did not excel at team sports, got his first set of weights at age 10. By 12 he was fervently working out with barbells and dumbbells.“They were my solid steel friends that I could trust,” he said in his book “A Glimpse in the Rear View” (2020), a compilation of columns from his website. “When the going got tough, when I kept missing the baseball, and when girls were far too cute to talk to, the weights were there and they spoke my language.”He bought his gear at Weider Barbell in Union City, N.J. — part of Joe Weider’s empire of muscle magazines, fitness equipment, supplements and competitions — and at 19 became the weekend manager of a gym in Jersey City. He also got a part-time job in the Weider Barbell warehouse, where he worked out with the other shipping clerks. Mr. Weider, who was known as the Master Blaster, gave Mr. Draper his Blond Bomber nickname.“He had the fire in the belly, don’t kid yourself,” Mr. Weider told GQ magazine for a profile of Mr. Draper in 2000. “He wouldn’t have gotten the kind of body he did without hard work.”After winning Mr. New Jersey, Mr. Draper moved to Santa Monica, where he continued to work for Mr. Weider. As Mr. Draper’s profile in bodybuilding rose, he appeared on the covers of magazines published by Mr. Weider, like Muscle Builder and Mr. America, and in ads for his equipment.Reflecting on his victory in the Mr. America event, held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Mr. Draper wrote that he took pride in being a “muscle-building original.”“I invented, improvised and rooted about, along with a small, disconnected band of rebels with a cause: to build solid muscle and might through the austere, hard labor of love — the lifting of iron,” he wrote in a column included in “A Glimpse in the Rear View.”In 1972 Mr. Draper sued Mr. Weider for not paying him for his endorsement of Mr. Weider’s gym and bodybuilding products. He settled for $17,500 before the jury was to deliver a verdict.Mr. Draper did not stop lifting weights until a year before he died.Once sober, he was hired as a special programmer at a gym in Santa Cruz. He married Laree Setterlund in 1988 and opened two World Gyms with her in the 1990s, which they owned and ran into the 2000s.In addition to his wife, he is survived by his sisters, Dana Harrison and Carla Scott; his brothers, Don and Jerry; two grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter. His daughter, Jamie Johnson, died in 2016. His marriage to Penny Koenemund ended in divorce.In one column, Mr. Draper contemplated what his life would have been like without weight lifting. The thought, he said, was unbearable.“No sets? No reps? No cunning determination of how to bombard the delts or blast the biceps?” he wrote. “Days on end without pursuing extreme pain through maximum muscle exertion?” He added: “Full body, full strength, full breath and fulfillment are lost, gone, no more: nary a remnant to remind, disappoint or shame. Shoot me!”"
4,The 2021 Baseball Trivia Extravaganza,,,
5,A Christmas Visit That Changed Everything,"After a long wait, Gil Hodges was elected to the Hall of Fame. For one of the many people whose lives he helped change with community work, Hodges was already a legend.","Dec. 24, 2021","For 72 years, David Schacker has held on to a tattered black-and-white photograph, now buried deep in a closet at his home near downtown Toronto. A few days ago, shortly after Gil Hodges was elected to the Hall of Fame, he decided to take a fresh look. The image has lost some of its luster but the excitement still shines through: a bright-eyed kid, just one month shy of turning 11, beaming as he shakes hands with a local legend.Hodges came to St. Giles hospital in December 1949 to visit a group of young boys who were recovering from polio. He arrived in a full Santa suit — complete with a beard, a hat and boots — but the disguise didn’t fool anyone. The boys had spent the past few months cooped up inside, huddled around a 12 ½ -inch Stromberg-Carlson television set. When they weren’t going through their daily physiotherapy, they were watching Brooklyn Dodgers games. And Hodges, who was voted into his first All-Star Game that year, played in 156 of them. They knew who he was the minute he walked through that door.Hodges made his way over to Schacker and stuck out his hand. All these years later, Schacker still remembers how big the massive first baseman’s hand was — yet how gentle Hodges seemed close-up. This was an All-Star, a man who had just driven in 115 runs and knocked out 170 hits, and here he was, sitting on Schacker’s hospital bed in Crown Heights, beaming back at him.To say it was a surreal experience would be an understatement. The previous few months had been a struggle for Schacker, who was a gifted tennis player and a speedy runner. Instead of smacking balls from the baseline or running through the streets of Bay Ridge, he found himself undergoing hours of daily physical therapy. It was not a 10-year-old’s idea of a good time. But from September 1949 until June 1950, it was his reality.The Dodgers made those nine months bearable. Schacker had been a die-hard fan since 1946, raised on teams of Pete Reiser, Dixie Walker and Kirby Higbe. He had never owned a TV, so watching his favorite players hit and run and steal in real time was exhilarating. Though Hodges was just at the beginning of his Hall of Fame career, Schacker knew he was something special, and not only for his talent. This was a player who lived in Brooklyn year-round. The Dodgers’ first baseman could be seen walking his dog down the block. He could be seen at the corner store buying cigarettes, or stopping for milk on his way back from the ballpark. In many ways, Hodges felt like one of them: a neighbor, a familiar face, a friend.“A surprise visit from Gil Hodges was more like a visit from a fellow Brooklynite, although a revered one, than a visit from some remote superstar stepping down from Mount Olympus, like Joe DiMaggio,” Schacker said. “It was a unique time in a unique place with a unique team.”Beneficence was at the core of Hodges, and it seeped into his game. He knew his role — hitting the ball for distance — and stuck to it. For the first baseman, driving a runner in from third was more important than hitting for average. To this day, he holds the M.L.B. record for the most sacrifice flies in a single season, with 19, in 1954.It wasn’t enough for him to help his team, though; Hodges also felt a personal responsibility to help his community. In this era of multimillion-dollar contracts, it is hard to imagine an All-Star first baseman going out of his way to drive a postman that he’d recently met to his home in Mill Basin, or donating $500 (a hefty sum on a 1950s salary) to a Jewish day school that had been vandalized. It’s even harder to imagine that these acts were done quietly, and not out of a desire to self-promote. But by all accounts, his intentions were pure.“He just couldn’t drive past the bus stop and leave someone without giving him a lift,” said his biographer, Mort Zachter. “Most would have driven by, but he stopped.“There must be countless examples of him doing this kind of thing that we are not aware of, acts of kindness that are lost to time.”For 72 years, Schacker has held his black-and-white photo close. It has survived a 500-mile move from Brooklyn to Toronto, and all of his stops in between. He keeps it, not only as a keepsake of an unexpected act of kindness, but as a reminder that sometimes, life’s seemingly devastating turns can take us where we’re meant to go.Even after he was released from St. Giles, Schacker’s diagnosis made his routine uncomfortable. A former left-handed stickball player, he quickly had to learn how to throw and bat right-handed, because the disease had impaired his left arm and hand. He wasn’t able to run races anymore, and was forced to find a new hobby, which brought him to writing. He became the sports editor of his high school newspaper, and ended up attending Cornell University.It was there that he met a friend, Dick Hampton. One night, in 1962, Schacker and Hampton were playing a board game at the Figaro, a coffeehouse in Greenwich Village, when two women from Vassar College walked in. Hampton happened to know one of them; the other, Maxine, would become Schacker’s wife of 58 years.“Suppose I’d gone to some other school on an athletic scholarship,” he said. “I wouldn’t have been at Cornell to meet the guy who was with me years later in Greenwich Village, when I met Maxine. One change in your life can change everything that follows.”Maxine and David moved to Toronto in 1973, where David worked in advertising and Maxine worked as an artist. In 1996, she founded a private college called Max the Mutt College of Animation, Art & Design, while David worked on the publicity and marketing side of the business. It has since expanded, and in 1999, became a government-recognized private career college. Max the Mutts graduates work for companies like Pixar, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Warner Bros. Games, and more. David retired in 2005, but Maxine remains one of its co-directors.In 2017, David achieved a career highlight of his own, by publishing his first children’s book, “The Life and Times of Sir Reginald Tubb,” about an abandoned bathtub that is taken home by a family of bears. He’s currently working on his next book project.Schacker often thinks back to his time in Brooklyn. For a while, the only golden ages he knew of were the ones you read in history books, the years of Ruth and Gehrig and DiMaggio and Hodges. While he was attending games at Ebbets Field, and watching them on a tiny television at St. Giles, it never occurred to him that he could be living in a golden age of his own. But he says he won’t make the same mistake twice.“Maxine and I are an unbeatable team,” he said. “My life might have gone an entirely different way if not for my diagnosis in 1949. I might have gone to a different college, I might have had different friends, I might have been a standout athlete. But my life might not have been as happy as it has been.”"
6,Our Favorite Sports Photos of 2021,,"Dec. 23, 2021","We asked some of our photographers to choose their favorite sports images that they made this year and tell us why they liked them. Take a look.I got an email from an editor at The New York Times about a skateboarding project and immediately thought of Naiomi Glasses, whose skateboarding videos on TikTok have gone viral. Glasses, 24, wears her traditional Navajo skirt, turquoise jewelry and hair bun as she sails across the sandstone on a board and four wheels.I met her at a gas station in Rock Point, Ariz., and we went up a mountain. I found a spot and followed her with my camera as she skateboarded effortlessly until the sun went down. This is one of my favorite photographs because it shows the beauty of skateboarding and the Navajo Nation.Ku Stevens ran to honor his ancestors, including his great-grandfather, who had escaped an Indigenous boarding school. He also ran to become a champion. Last month, Ku won the Nevada state title for the fastest high school distance runner.The day after, Ku and his father, Delmar Stevens, offered tobacco to the four directions and the creator. I wanted to frame the moment from inside the family’s sweat lodge, so I ran inside and waited. When Ku and Delmar stepped into the frame, I waited for Delmar to raise his hand to offer tobacco to the west direction. I knew that was the moment I was aiming for. This is one of my favorite photographs because it shows the unconditional love between father and son and their love for their culture. It is about acknowledging the past, moving forward, embracing change and keeping traditions alive.After Ku and his family stepped into the sweat lodge, I sat outside and listened as they sang a traditional Navajo song. I am Navajo, from the Navajo Nation reservation; I was 879 miles away from home, but I felt close to home.Compelling sports photography captures the spirit of competition, and some of the best moments are found on the periphery. This image, from our piece about the efforts to build skate parks across Montana, speaks to the resilience it takes to survive on a skateboard. It reminds me of learning to ride a skateboard as a kid. The pain and the sweat. The sense of freedom. The mix of individuality and camaraderie. While the sport has grown in popularity — it made its Olympic debut in Tokyo this year — it is still defined as much by the kids at the skate park as it is by the pros.I was 27 weeks pregnant when I photographed Cody Simpson, the Australian pop star who dreams of being an Olympian, during his swimming practice in January. The golden-hour light was coming in perfectly, and I had to keep reminding myself to watch my balance so that I wouldn’t follow the light to the point that my gear and I ended up in the pool.I remember Ruthie kicking as I lay next to the edge of the pool. I was so excited that I would be able to tell her about these moments together one day. That, plus the light and the subject combined in a magical way.When I was growing up in Southern California, almost everyone I knew played competitive sports from a young age. The amount of money and time families spend on sports to try to get their children into the best colleges is incredible.When I got to St. John Bosco High School’s stadium in early October, I wanted to examine the blurred lines between amateur and professional sports here, while referencing the photographer Robert Clark’s classic work for the original “Friday Night Lights” book. I used three cameras, both digital and film, but the film photos turned out to be the closest to what I had in mind.Our society puts lots of pressure on teenagers and young adults to perform, to achieve, to be “successful.” I hope we continue to report stories that examine this bargain.Photographers at gymnastics events often position a remote-controlled camera on a catwalk pointing down at the balance beam or the uneven bars. It’s a safe bet for great pictures.But on the last day of the U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials in June, held in St. Louis, I climbed to the other side of the arena to put my remote camera above the vault, hoping I could capture Simone Biles performing one of her signature moves, the Yurchenko double pike. It’s a move so dangerous that no other women attempt it in competition.You don’t see many bird’s-eye pictures of the vault because they’re hard to pull off: The action happens quickly and you only have one shot at the perfect moment. (There are plenty of chances to photograph a gymnast on the uneven bars or balance beam.) But I figured it would be worth the effort if Biles pulled off the move.Biles can fly so high that it’s hard to focus the camera ahead of time on where you think she will be. To prepare for overhead photos, I usually ask someone on the floor to raise a monopod high in the air holding a piece of cardboard with an X on it, so I can focus on the X. But Biles can fly higher than anyone can lift the cardboard, so this shot came down to guesswork.When it was Biles’s turn on the vault, she decided not to perform the Yurchenko double pike, opting for a less strenuous vault to protect her ankles ahead of the Olympics. But when I finally got to see the picture, even though it wasn’t the famous move I was hoping for, I was happy with it. I had never seen a remote picture of the vault from a catwalk, and it looked great.In August, Carli Lloyd, 39, announced her retirement, ending her brilliant soccer career. I spent much of October going to her final games and retirement party, where I saw firsthand the influence that one person can have on the game. Fans who were too young to remember her hat trick in the 2015 World Cup final against Japan were chanting her name and hoping for autographs from one of the greatest of all time.Rooting for the success of women’s sports in this country can be a daunting task, but when soccer can produce players like Lloyd, the possibilities are endless for the beautiful game.After more than a year without much to celebrate, it was a pleasure being with these fans in New York City as Italy won the European soccer championship. England started the final strong with an early goal, but Italy leveled the score in the 67th minute and the game remained tied until a tense penalty shootout.With one final save by goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, the street erupted in celebration. Flares were lit and champagne popped to the sounds of techno “Bella Ciao” remixes. At the Tokyo Olympics, the finest athletes in the world competed in stadiums that were empty except for fellow athletes, officials and volunteers. Most Japanese fans hoping to cheer on their favorite stars had to do so in front of a television.This was a particular disappointment for fans of softball and baseball, both wildly popular in Japan, which were returning to the Olympic schedule for the first time since 2008.In the gold medal softball match, second-ranked Japan and the top-ranked United States, the two powerhouses of the sport, faced off once again in an Olympic final. The Japanese team prevailed, just as it had in 2008. Even with the stands almost empty, the sweetness of victory on home soil was clearly etched on the players’ faces.I arrived at South Cameron High School in southwest Louisiana at first light, a few days before Hurricane Ida would sweep through the state. Cameron Parish had already been devastated by Hurricane Laura a year earlier, and the high school gym had been leveled, leaving athletes nowhere to practice.The matter-of-fact nature of the athletes being asked to pack up the sports equipment before a storm was a reality check. There was some urgency to store the equipment because school was being let out early that day to leave a few days for families to evacuate. But mostly, this felt like a normal activity for the coach and the students, as if the effects of climate change have simply become part of their routine.It was a long day walking around Grand Isle, La., under the blazing sun. We met up with Londyn Resweber, 14, at her family’s house on the eastern side of the island. Fortunately for them, the eastern side hadn’t been damaged as severely as the western side by Hurricane Ida.It was amazing to see Londyn’s determination to continue to train for the state cross-country championships, especially since none of her teammates have returned to Grand Isle after evacuating. We rode in a golf cart with her mother, who was pacing her as she ran through the sand-filled, windswept landscape. Londyn went on to place 25th, after coming in fifth last year. I think it’s fair to say that a hurricane leveling your town is a perfectly acceptable reason for not finishing as high as you would hope. But what stuck with me was everyone’s determination to not let these regular disasters distract Londyn from her goals."
7,Inside the Mind of Kyler Murray,,,"TEMPE, Ariz. — Kyler Murray never played soccer beyond the FIFA video game, but when Real Madrid and its star forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, visited the Cotton Bowl in Dallas to play an exhibition against AS Roma, he made sure he got tickets.He admired Ronaldo’s dynamism, his goal-scoring prowess, his flair, and in those days, a week shy of his 17th birthday, Murray evoked a schoolboy version of Ronaldo, capable of implausible levels of sorcery every time he played football or baseball. He had already quarterbacked the Allen High Eagles to two state titles (with a third to come), and he knew he could play either game, or both, in college and the pros.But as he watched some of the world’s best soccer players, Murray pondered an alternate future, not in football but in fútbol. Turning to his godfather, Mark Johnson, he asked how many years it would take him to be as good as Ronaldo, who, after all, had practiced his entire life to get to be Ronaldo. Johnson, weighing Murray’s athleticism against his inexperience, posited four, maybe five.Nah, Murray said — it wouldn’t take that long.“And he was dead serious,” Johnson said. “That’s how Kyler thinks.”The mind of Kyler Cole Murray is a mysterious, wondrous place. It enables him, at 5-foot-10 the shortest starting quarterback in the N.F.L., to foresee certain touchdown passes five days before throwing them and to evade defenders like a motorbike weaving through traffic. It endows him with the confidence and self-discipline to conjure a reality that matches his towering expectations, but also with an aversion to the attention that has come with his rise from multisport phenomenon to N.F.L. superstar with the Arizona Cardinals, who, despite losing their last two games, remain atop the N.F.C. West at 10-4.The only athlete ever selected in the first round of the N.F.L. and Major League Baseball drafts, Murray, 24, is, if not quite a reluctant celebrity, then a reclusive one. From the start, he has unapologetically refused to conform, either to football doctrine or to the perceptions of how a quarterback should act, look and lead.Murray does not watch much game film. He tends to hold the ball outstretched when he runs, anathema to every coach who has instructed him not to (to which Murray has said, “When they get close, I’ll tuck it”). He is the rare person who didn’t have to adjust his behavior during the pandemic because he preferred hanging out at home anyway. His coach, Kliff Kingsbury, calls him “an introverted cat.” Murray favors the term “low-key.”“I tell him, ‘God wouldn’t allow me to have your talent, man,’” Kingsbury said, “because I would have been in all sorts of trouble.”Growing up, Murray knew people who made bad decisions and squandered their gifts. Resolving not to join them, he abstained from party-hopping or anything else that might jeopardize the trajectory he had plotted for himself. More than a decade later, he still does. After completing what has become known as the Hail Murray — a game-winning touchdown pass flung into triple coverage to stun Buffalo last season — he retreated to his residence and played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare over Twitch.“I don’t want to be the guy out and about, I don’t want to be the guy seen,” Murray said in a recent interview at Cardinals headquarters. “If you see me, you see me. If you don’t, you don’t.” And if he is spotted out, Murray said he is friendly, but acknowledged that people might be intimidated talking to him.Friends and teammates acknowledge that it takes time to earn Murray’s trust because he makes them earn it. He needs to know, they said, that you want to win as badly as he does, or at least won’t slow him down.“With Kyler,” said Tejan Koroma, a close friend from Allen, “I’d think you’d have no choice but to follow or get out of his way.”The same summer he went to see Ronaldo play, Murray issued another declaration that fascinated Johnson. This one proved more prescient.“You know,” Murray told him, “I can do what Russell Wilson does.”Murray wasn’t searching for affirmation or trying to convince himself so much as thinking aloud. Wilson had just won the Super Bowl, in the 2013 season, and his success with Seattle as a 5-foot-11 quarterback heralded a philosophical shift. No longer did an N.F.L. prototype at the position exist. Regardless of height, there was space for creative, athletic, accurate quarterbacks.It was as if Murray and his father, Kevin, had foreseen this moment.A former quarterback at Texas A&M and a draft pick of the Milwaukee Brewers, Kevin Murray is now a private quarterback tutor in North Texas. Under him, Murray learned routes and defenses and proper mechanics. Kevin Murray inculcated such sound fundamentals that college coaches, when reviewing film of Murray shot from behind, marveled how he used his hips and torso to throw.“They told me that if they didn’t think it would offend the quarterbacks in their room,” Jeff Fleener, Murray’s offensive coordinator at Allen, said in an interview last year, “they would show them high school footage of what the lower half of Kyler’s body looked like.”From early on, he wasn’t like the other kids. While other youth football teams focused on rushing, Murray’s offense split four receivers wide. He was 9. In middle school, he would gather teammates at his home for extra practice, then call plays during games that he devised. At 15, with his heels planted on the 45-yard line, he would, by rotating his upper body and flicking his wrist, loft spirals flat-footed into a 50-gallon trash can situated in the back corner of the end zone.“His go-to line was always, ‘It’s easy,’ but he never bragged or showboated about any of it,” Kendall Clinton, an Allen teammate, said. “It’s like he was born to do what he does. I used to look at him like, you know, maybe I should be more like him.”That line — “It’s easy” — has been Murray’s Twitter bio for years, co-opted from the basketball player Quincy Miller, whose BallIsLife videos he devoured on YouTube. To Murray, sports are to be conquered, not played. He did not just learn chess as a boy, he won elementary-school championships. When his longtime trainer, Stephen Baca, beat him in the board game Sequence, Murray took the game home to improve. After the Oakland Athletics drafted Murray with the ninth pick in 2018, they invited him, as part of introductory festivities, to take batting practice. To prepare, he hit for three hours on three consecutive days.“I knew what I wanted to do in my life,” Murray said. “In order to get there, going out and doing drugs, none of that was for me. I’ve never smoked in my life. I want to be the greatest to ever play. That’s always been my mentality.”Probing deeper into that mentality, one M.L.B. team, while scouting him heading into the draft, developed a psychological profile. The results revealed traits that signified an elite mental makeup: intense competitiveness and both an inability to understand losing and cope with it. This didn’t surprise Johnson, who said he used to have a running joke with Murray’s mother, Missy: A career in sports better work out for him, they said, because otherwise, he wouldn’t make a very good employee.“Some of those qualities that you have as an athlete, if you carried them into your personal life, you might be a bad human being,” Johnson said. “Kyler doesn’t have the ability to be empathetic out there. If you don’t want to win, if you don’t want to compete, he literally doesn’t understand it. It doesn’t compute in his brain.”Murray started 43 games at Allen. He won them all. Before his final college season, at Oklahoma, he confided in a few people that he would win the Heisman Trophy, which he did. As a reward, Murray went No. 1 overall to the team that had lost the most games in the N.F.L. a season before.Murray arrived at rookie minicamp in 2019 and texted Johnson to say how much harder the N.F.L. was. At Oklahoma, he didn’t have Aaron Donald calling out Arizona’s plays at the line of scrimmage, nor did he have older teammates whose livelihoods depended on him. At Allen, he could remark that the other team was “trash” and promise to throw for 400 yards — then go out and do it.But in the N.F.L., everyone was bigger, stronger, faster. He felt like he had to prove himself, to gain credibility, before he could tell teammates what to do.As the Cardinals spiraled in Murray’s rookie season, dropping seven of their final nine games to finish 5-10-1, he told Chase Edmonds and another teammate, Christian Kirk, that he wouldn’t tolerate any more losing. That they would make the playoffs the next season.“When he said that, it was like, ‘I don’t know what you all have been doing here, but it’s going to be different now,’” said Edmonds, one of Murray’s closest friends on the team. “He doesn’t come off as standoffish or arrogant, but I think he got humbled.” Even though Murray said he never changed who he was, people around him have noticed an evolution, as a player and as a teammate. He has started telling receivers before every game, “We’re the best, be the best,” and has become a fixture at offensive line dinners, held at guard Justin Pugh’s house.Murray credited the presence of Colt McCoy, the veteran backup he said he didn’t even realize he was missing until McCoy joined the Cardinals this year. McCoy, in his 12th season, said he has never played with anyone who has as much intuition or feel at the position. Other young quarterbacks might overthink; Murray, he said, plays with an uncluttered mind.As an example, McCoy mentioned Murray’s Week 4 touchdown pass against the Rams to tight end Maxx Williams. The first option, McCoy said, was Edmonds, coming out of the backfield. But Murray knew the Tuesday before the game that if Los Angeles presented a certain coverage, he would throw over the middle to Williams. Murray was so confident that, when the ball was snapped, he never even looked toward Edmonds.“I think I was blessed with the cognitive skills to just go out there and just see it before it happens,” Murray said. “I’m not one of those guys that’s going to sit there and kill myself watching film. I don’t sit there for 24 hours and break down this team and that team and watch every game because, in my head, I see so much.”Sometimes, when he needs a break, he turns his eyes elsewhere, either to video games or to his favorite movie: “The Great Gatsby.” It inspired the pink pinstriped suit he wore to the N.F.L. draft. The first time he saw the film, he said, he was hooked. The themes of hope and love and the American dream resonated for Murray. So did the title character, Jay Gatsby, a complex and inscrutable stranger.“The fact that he could throw these huge parties, nobody’s ever met him, nobody knows who he is, nobody knows what he looks like,” Murray said.“That, to me, was so, so cool.”"
8,Fear and Falsehoods Fill the Premier League’s Vaccination Gap,,"Dec. 22, 2021","The report spread like wildfire. Premier League players shared the link among their peers. Some passed it to their family members and closest confidantes. A handful were sufficiently troubled by what it seemed to suggest that they presented it to their clubs’ in-house medical teams, seeking advice.It had been produced by a website that says it tracks the number of “young athletes who had major medical issues in 2021 after receiving one or more Covid vaccines.” The report claimed to list 19 “athletes” — mostly in the United States — who it said had experienced heart attacks after being inoculated. Some of the attacks, the site noted ominously, had been fatal.Almost immediately, the doctors and others spotted the glaring flaws in the research. One of the examples cited was Hank Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player, who had died in January. He was 86. Another name on the list, a former N.B.A. player, had been 64. The most cursory research showed that many of the younger athletes, too, had documented, underlying conditions.But that did not matter. Nor did the fact that the report was subsequently and comprehensively debunked. It had made the soccer players question whether they should agree to be vaccinated. The damage, at least in the view of medical experts, had been done.These are not easy weeks for the Premier League, which is currently enduring a surge in virus cases, a glut of postponements — two more games were postponed on Thursday — and calls even from within its ranks to take at least a temporary pause in the season. Those troubles have placed its lagging vaccination record under fierce scrutiny, and prompted questions as to why the richest league in the world has had such trouble convincing its stars to get the shot.In one light, the league and its teams have had considerable success: The Premier League has released figures suggesting that 84 percent of its stars are on their “vaccination journey,” meaning they have had at least one of a potential three shots since becoming eligible in the spring. The remaining 16 percent, though — around 100 players — has become a cause of concern.Six of the 10 Premier League games scheduled to be played last weekend were postponed after clubs were struck by Covid outbreaks. At least one of those matches is reported to have been called off not because of a raft of positive tests, but because a number of unvaccinated players were self-isolating, as British law requires, after being identified as close contacts of a confirmed case.The lost weekend highlighted the Premier League’s struggle to keep its vaccination figures on par with the rest of Europe’s major domestic competitions, and other top sports leagues around the world.Serie A, the Italian top flight, has vaccinated 98 percent of its players. In France, the figure stands at 95 percent, and in Germany 94 percent — numbers on par with the N.F.L., N.B.A. and N.H.L. in North America. Spain’s soccer authorities reported that, taking into account both vaccination and naturally-acquired immunity, 97 percent of players were fully covered. The comparison with England, then, is stark: In the Premier League, only 77 percent of players have had two vaccinations.Establishing the reason for that divergence is not straightforward. The New York Times spoke with an array of players, advisers, executives, officials and medical staff members, most on condition of anonymity because they are not permitted to discuss private health matters. Those interviews painted a complex, inchoate portrait of why vaccine hesitancy has been allowed to become so embedded in the richest soccer league in the world.“It’s tough to say there is one thing,” said Maheta Molango, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, Britain’s players’ union. “It really is on a case-by-case basis.”Concern about possible side effects has, certainly, become widespread. A spate of recent, high-profile incidents involving players enduring heart problems while on the field — including Christian Eriksen, the Denmark midfielder who collapsed at last summer’s European Championship, and Sergio Agüero, the Barcelona striker who just retired — has fueled suspicion of the vaccines among some players.Some medical staff at clubs contend the suspicion has been encouraged by a handful of retired players — including the former England midfielder Matt Le Tissier and Trevor Sinclair, once of Manchester City and West Ham — who have publicly identified on-field incidents as a possible consequence of vaccination. That Eriksen had not been vaccinated when he collapsed on a field during the Euros in June has made little difference.But incidents involving others are far from the only source of skepticism. According to reporting by The Times, several players have expressed concern that the vaccine might reduce their sperm count, and a number of doctors revealed they had faced questions about links to decreased virility particularly after the musician Nicki Minaj tweeted that a family friend had suffered “swollen testicles” as a result of the vaccine. (Both theories are unfounded.)Molango suggested that some players may have “concerns around religion,” too. Earlier this year, the P.F.A. and the Premier League arranged for Jonathan Van Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer — who has regularly used soccer-themed metaphors during his public statements — to address the captains of the league’s 20 clubs in a bid to encourage more players to be vaccinated.During the meeting, he was asked if it was true the vaccines contained alcohol — a concern for Muslim players. He confirmed that the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was alcohol-free, but acknowledged that others could contain trace amounts. But the amounts were so minuscule, he told the captains, that “there was probably more alcohol in the bread you ate this morning.”Others have “questions around the credibility” of those encouraging them to be vaccinated, Molango said. Some players have noted, too, that it was deemed safe for them to return to work last year, before the vaccines had been developed, and that they did not appreciate now being told to be vaccinated in order to keep on playing.In some cases, that has crystallized into something more implacable: an ideological refusal to have the shot. Most players, though, are more hesitant than opposed, team employees said — inclined to think that as healthy young men, they will not suffer even if they contract the virus, and therefore do not need to take whatever risk there may or may not be in a vaccine. Their bodies are their livelihoods, after all, and many have told medical staff members at their clubs that they would not take anything that is not irrefutably safe.And yet that does not fully explain why players in the Premier League — the overwhelming majority of whom are not British, let alone English — should be more resistant than their peers in other major leagues.While the proportion of Premier League players vaccinated is broadly similar to the number of people in their age group to have been inoculated in England, elite soccer is hardly a representative sample. It is, after all, gleefully international. The more apt parallel, then, may be with Serie A and La Liga and the others, where the mix of professionals is almost as global as it is in the Premier League, and where vaccination rates are far higher.The Premier League contends it has done as much as it reasonably can do to persuade its players to accept the inoculations. Van Tam not only addressed the captains of the league’s clubs but also released a video, highlighting the importance of vaccination and dispelling myths, to reinforce the message. He has visited teams in person. Other clubs, struggling to persuade their holdouts to be vaccinated, have been offered visits from experts eager to answer questions and allay fears.The clubs, too, have “played their part,” as Molango put it. Many have invited medical teams into their training facilities to make it as easy as possible for players to get a shot. At Liverpool, Jürgen Klopp has been an outspoken advocate of the “moral” imperative to be vaccinated. Leeds United officials have made vaccination a nonnegotiable part of a player’s duty to his teammates, and at other teams players have embraced vaccinations after being shaken by the experiences of teammates who tested positive, or the effect that Covid-related deaths have had on friends and colleagues.Other clubs, though, have been accused of being too light a touch, of not offering enough guidance to players early on, of giving the illusion that there was no real urgency. That, critics say, created a space in which misinformation could flourish. One Premier League team initially encouraged players to be vaccinated on their own time. When that did not receive much response, executives dropped the hint again. It was only after a few weeks that the club, realizing it had hit a wall, took the step of inviting a vaccination team to the training facility.Clubs’ approaches, though, are starting to shift. This summer, a number of transfer deals included clauses written into player contracts stating that vaccination was mandatory. Agents expect that to become the norm over the next few months: Klopp, like Aston Villa’s Steven Gerrard and Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta, has made it clear that his club would prefer not to sign unvaccinated players.Internal measures are growing more strict, too. At least one Premier League club no longer permits unvaccinated players to dine with their teammates, and requires them to change into their training gear either before arriving or in their car, instead of in the dressing room. The Premier League is now considering adapting its protocols to make similar precautions more widespread.The hope, among those charged with keeping the players safe, is that a more active, more draconian stance will prove decisive among all but a few ardent holdouts. Until then, all the league can do is try to counteract the misinformation, change all the minds it can, and hope that the games can go on."
9,Closing In on the Great One,,"Dec. 22, 2021","WASHINGTON — The Washington Capitals have a locker room tradition to honor player milestones, led by Peter Laviolette, their coach. When someone records a notable assist or pots his first career goal, Laviolette announces it to the team and often hands out the puck to commemorate the moment.With Alex Ovechkin, Laviolette can barely keep up.“It’s to the point where I get handed a piece of paper after the game with a list of things he’s just done,” Laviolette said this month, as Ovechkin shoots his way to the top of the most cherished record in hockey. “There was a game last week where we had five things and we threw one out, just because of the time. It’s unbelievable.”Ovechkin, who turned 36 in September, has not only dominated his coach’s postgame speeches, he has captured the attention of the entire National Hockey League with an early outpouring of goals and assists to showcase that the rugged and supremely talented left winger is still as good as he ever was, still the Great 8.He had 22 goals heading into the Christmas break, which began early when the N.H.L. paused play until next week because of the coronavirus.Ovechkin is one goal behind the league leader, Leon Draisaitl of the Edmonton Oilers, and his 25 assists put Ovechkin third in points behind Draisaitl and his Oilers teammate Connor McDavid, each of whom has 49. He is only the seventh player with 17 consecutive 20-goal seasons, and is on a pace to score 58 goals, which would be the second-highest total of his remarkable 17-year career, and the third-highest tally for any player over age 30.And most recently, Laviolette honored Ovechkin for tying Dave Andreychuk for the most career power play goals, 274.But there is a grander list on which he ascends. This year, Ovechkin passed Marcel Dionne and Brett Hull on the career goals list. With 752, Ovechkin is only 15 goals from passing Jaromir Jagr for third place. From there, only Gordie Howe, with 801, and Wayne Gretzky’s 894 lie ahead.“It’s not even a question that he will pass me, and I think it’s great,” Gretzky said in a telephone interview last week. “He’s well on his way to 40 or 50 goals this year, maybe more. There is no doubt that ultimately, he will break the record.”On the surface, Gretzky and Ovechkin could not be more different. Gretzky was a slender vision on ice, the greatest playmaker of all time with his blond locks flowing out of his Jofa helmet, the winner of four Stanley Cups and nine Hart trophies as the most valuable player, all while racking up incomprehensible point totals for teams in four N.H.L. cities.Ovechkin, with his shaggy, graying mane, his gaptoothed smile, boisterous persona and linebacker frame (he is every bit of his 6-3, 240 pounds) is a more direct force, whose bruising, power style and sizzling slap shot helped him accrue three Hart trophies and a Stanley Cup, all in one adoring city — and made him one of the most feared opponents in the game.“He has an aura on the ice,” said T.J. Oshie, Ovechkin’s teammate on the Capitals. “He’s like a shark out there.”In that sense, Ovechkin and Gretzky are quite similar; each with an unparalleled competitive drive and understanding for what it takes to get a puck past a goalie. Five years ago, the two went to dinner at Nobu in Malibu, along with their wives, a hockey summit arranged by Sergey Kocharov, the Capitals vice president for communications, who also worked with Gretzky when both were with the Phoenix Coyotes.During the meal, Ovechkin peppered Gretzky with questions.“What I found really nice was that he wasn’t asking me about scoring goals — he doesn’t need to ask anyone about that,” Gretzky said. “He wanted to know about getting his team over the line to win the Stanley Cup. It was refreshing.”The odd couple remain in contact, and Gretzky, like many hockey fans, regularly tunes in to Capitals games because of his appreciation for Ovechkin. If Ovechkin goes a few games without scoring, Gretzky sends supportive texts, reminding the sturdy Russian that the goals will come, and sometimes in bunches.“I’m his biggest fan,” said Gretzky, whose 2,857 career points put him 936 ahead of Jagr in second place and 1,490 ahead of Ovechkin.But the career goal record, much like the home run record in baseball, is among the most cherished and easily identifiable markers in sports. Gretzky’s mark of 894 was once considered insurmountable. But Ovechkin could soar past 900.When asked about it, Ovechkin usually says that “one never knows” what will happen tomorrow. But that insatiable craving to score has fueled him since he was a boy. When he was 12 and playing in the Russian juniors for Dynamo Moscow, Ovechkin went into the final game of that season with 53 goals.“Before the game my father told me that Pavel Bure held the record with 57 goals,” Ovechkin recalled, then flashed his famous smile. “I scored six goals and finished with 59. You never know.”Ovechkin has led the N.H.L. in goals a record nine times. Many of his tallies have come via his ballistic slap shot and one-timers, but others through wrist shots, tap-ins, backhands, deft stickhandling maneuvers and even one crazy backhander, over his head, while sliding on his back, against Gretzky’s Coyotes, followed by one of his signature, exuberant celebrations.“I’ve always loved to score goals,” Ovechkin said. “I remember when I was a little kid, I loved the competition to see where you were at in the standings, goals, assists, points, whatever.”But setting him apart from all the other greats, Ovechkin is perhaps the most physical elite scorer the game has seen. He is willing to check and be checked, like Howe and Brett Hull, but Ovechkin sometimes seeks it out.Of the top goal scorers since 2005-6, the year he barged into the league after being drafted No. 1 in 2004 (what should have been his rookie season was canceled by a lockout), Ovechkin not only has 200 more goals than Sidney Crosby, Steven Stamkos, Eric Staal and Evgeni Malkin, he has well over 2,000 more career hits than any of them. (According to the NHL Network’s statistics, Ovechkin had over 3,160 hits through November, and none of the others had even 1,000.)He has 42 hits this season, as many as his scoring rivals McDavid and Draisaitl combined.Oshie recalled how he once bore the brunt of a crushing Ovechkin check when Oshie played for the St. Louis Blues, comparing it to being hit by a truck.“There’s a number of great goal scorers in the league,” he said. “None of them hits like Ovi does. It’s what makes him so great. He’s a monster.”As a teammate, Oshie feels Ovechkin’s physicality in other ways. There are the pregame chest bumps in the hallway, when the loud, gregarious winger ramps up for the game. The more dangerous moments for his teammates come when one of them scores.“He hugged me so hard once, I was like, ‘OK, I need to see the trainer,’” Oshie said. “He’s like a 2-year-old puppy that doesn’t know how big he is.”Ovechkin no longer flies across the rink razing defensemen as often as he once did. Now, he picks his spots. In a recent game against Chicago, the Capitals were lethargic until Ovechkin flattened Connor Murphy early in the second period, changing the momentum. During the intermission, Laviolette informed the team that if their superstar could be that physical, everyone else could do the same.“That looked like the old Ovi,” Laviolette said. “He still brings it when we need it.”But Ovechkin has a refined side, too. Gretzky compares him to his old teammate Mark Messier and to the quarterback Tom Brady and the tennis legend Roger Federer, veteran superstars who maintained their success into their later 30s and beyond through up-to-date nutrition and training regimens, combined with a relentless competitive drive.“I’ve never seen anyone with the hunger he has with the puck,” said Nicklas Backstrom, Ovechkin’s longtime linemate, who has assisted on 269 (35.8 percent) of his goals. “It doesn’t matter if he gets it in his own zone, neutral zone, anywhere. He’s thinking, ‘I’m scoring,’ which is unique.”Ovechkin says he is “very lucky” to have played so long with Backstrom and other talented teammates, like Evgeny Kuznetsov. Backstrom and Ovechkin have been together for 14 years — including 19 games for Dynamo Moscow during the 2012-13 N.H.L. lockout — enough that they know where the other one will be almost all the time, on or off the ice.“Well, if I don’t see him somewhere, I’ll hear him,” quipped Backstrom, who also noted Ovechkin’s ability to be in the right spot.Watching Ovechkin find those spots without the puck is a study in hockey geometry, bringing to mind Oshie’s shark imagery. His short, precise movements — side to side, forward and back — just to find even an extra inch of space — can be the difference in getting off a lethal shot.Brian MacLellan, the Capitals’ general manager, says that this year, Ovechkin has elevated his already uncanny sense of the play and how it will develop.“He’s the smartest he’s ever been in the offensive zone,” MacLellan said. “It’s an intelligent game he’s playing. He’s evolved from powering goals in, to what he’s doing now.”Of Ovechkin’s 22 goals this year, only two have come via his signature one-timer — a massive slap shot taken directly off a pass, usually from the left face-off circle to the goalie’s right, an area on the ice commonly known as Ovechkin’s “office.” Eleven have come off wrist shots and four on snap shots.Sometimes, though, it is less about calculations, tactics and vision. If a young player were to ask Ovechkin for the secret formula to scoring goals by the hundreds, he offers unsurprisingly direct advice.“Shoot the puck,” Ovechkin said, smiling.As hard as you can?“Yup.”Ovechkin has carved out a Hall of Fame career doing that, making it hard for goalies, and for a coach trying to keep track of it all, with no end in sight."
10,The New Mets Manager’s Goal Is Simple: Be the ‘Last Team Standing’,"In an introductory news conference, Buck Showalter applauded Steven Cohen for taking away the team’s excuses for not winning the World Series.",,"In most any other year, Buck Showalter’s first order of business upon taking over a new team would be to call players and fire off text messages. In baseball’s off-season, that is the easiest way to start getting to know players before spring training starts in mid-February.But with the sport frozen because of a labor dispute in which Major League Baseball locked out the players, Showalter is not permitted to be in contact with players, nor are any club officials on any team. But that doesn’t mean that Showalter, the most experienced Mets manager in some time, hasn’t already started planning for next season.During an introductory video news conference with the Mets on Tuesday afternoon, Showalter said he has been talking to his pitching coach, Jeremy Hefner, about the possibility of an abbreviated spring training should the lockout bleed into the scheduled baseball calendar.“We have to prepare for the what-ifs of a short spring training, and that’s going to be a challenge,” said Showalter, who managed the crosstown Yankees during the 1994-95 players’ strike, which ended the 1994 season early and delayed the start of the 1995 season.“The communication part of it, that will catch up very quickly,” he continued. “The onus is on us to get that done. I want to make the players’ path as easy as possible. But getting a team ready and a potential short spring training, shame on us if we’re not prepared for that when it happens.“Usually with the normal spring training, you’ve got a buffer period where you know if you have a setback with a spring training arm or leg or whatever — a sore shoulder — you’ve got time for that to come back and make the start of the season,” he added. “But if you shorten up the spring, that buffer or safety net is not going to be there.”Showalter, 65, spoke for nearly an hour on Tuesday and it was clear that he has plenty of insight and ideas about how to run a team. He has managed over 3,000 major league games for four franchises — the Yankees, the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Texas Rangers and the Baltimore Orioles — and been named the American League Manager of the Year three times.The Mets, however, present a new challenge.Showalter joins a franchise that has had its share of turnover, losing and problems in recent years. But a new era might be dawning on the Mets: They have the richest majority owner in the sport (Steven A. Cohen), a new general manager (Billy Eppler), $255 million in new talent that was added this off-season (pitcher Max Scherzer, infielder Eduardo Escobar and outfielders Starling Marte and Mark Canha), and they currently sport the highest payroll in M.L.B. All of that comes with an expectation from Cohen that they will compete for a World Series title.“Steve continues to eliminate excuses for things that we might have for things we can’t do,” Showalter said. He added later about his task at hand: “Not a lot of lip service. It’s kind of a ‘show me’ situation.”His job description with the Mets, Showalter said, “isn’t to be competitive or try to win more games than you lose — it’s to be the last team standing.” And the intention is not to win the World Series just once, he added.A World Series title, though, has been missing from Showalter’s résumé, in addition to a league pennant. Only Houston Astros Manager Dusty Baker (1,987 victories) and Gene Mauch (who managed four clubs and had 1,902 wins) have won more games in major league history than Showalter (1,551) without claiming a World Series title. “It’s not something that is going to define my life, but I can tell you this: It does wake me up every day now,” he said.After his nine-year tenure with the Orioles ended in 2018 with a 115-loss season as the roster rebuilding began, Showalter worked for MLB Network and the YES Network as a television analyst. He interviewed for managerial jobs — such as the Los Angeles Angels’ vacancy that went to Joe Maddon when Eppler was their G.M. — but he didn’t land a new one until now. In those three years away from the dugout, baseball has changed in numerous ways, from the further involvement of front offices to the strategies employed in games, such as the use of openers to begin games rather than traditional starting pitchers.To get a sense for what to expect, Showalter said he picked the brains of the longtime managers Tony La Russa of the Chicago White Sox, Maddon and Baker, two of whom had absences from the dugout before returning.“It’s not like I’ve been out for 10 years,” Showalter said. “I’ve been pretty connected through television because I’m responsible for 30 teams instead of one. But I’m anxious to see. I’m going to go into it with an open mind. I do think you have to do certain things the same, as far as the things that allow you to win a baseball game. It’s a 90-foot-increment game.”Showalter said he was looking forward to working with the Mets’ analytics department, which has been significantly beefed up under Cohen. Although Showalter came up in an era when it wasn’t so prevalent, he explained that he had always embraced data and crunched numbers himself. With the Orioles, for example, they used defensive shifts but he said there simply wasn’t much funding for an analytics department. He pointed to his wife, who flanked him during the news conference and also wore Mets blue like him, as proof of his analytics credentials.“Angela used to do charts for me in the Florida State League about where guys would hit the ball,” Showalter said of his time as a minor league manager.He added later: “If somebody thinks that I’m going to go back to the hotel or the house and think that maybe we got beat because someone else had better or used information better than we did or analytics, you don’t know me very well. I have always been very spongeful with information to a fault. And just like everybody else, I don’t have a corner on it. There’s a lot of smart people in this game.”Sandy Alderson, the Mets’ president, said Showalter came “as close to anybody in baseball possibly can” to earning a 10 out of 10 score for this job. When Alderson was the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, he said he tried to hire Showalter as his team’s manager before Showalter opted for the expansion franchise Diamondbacks in 1998.“You don’t last as long as Buck and you don’t remain as interested in a person who’s been out of the game for three years if that person hasn’t been adaptable, if that person hasn’t been curious, if that person hasn’t been evolving with the game itself,” Alderson said.During his news conference, Showalter also talked about the need for accountability and good clubhouse culture (“there’s no place like it when you get it right”), the joy of playing in the big market of New York (“people are really living and dying with everything you do out there, and it’s fun doing it, but some people run from it”) and how much he liked the off-season moves by Cohen, Alderson and Eppler.At one point, Showalter named Marte and Escobar as examples of good additions to the Mets. Team officials are not supposed to discuss players publicly during the lockout. Showalter then quickly corrected himself.“I almost got there,” he said with a chuckle. “That’s the first time I messed up, right?”"
11,18 Sports Highlights From 2021 Worth Watching Again,,"Dec. 20, 2021","The sports world is entering another period of uncertainty, with a surge in coronavirus cases, more game postponements and questions about the Beijing Olympics.But 2021 was also a great year in sports. There were challenges and disruptions, but there were also plenty of memorable moments. Take a minute or two and scroll through this highlight reel of some of our favorite plays from the past year.Most of the time, a ground ball to the third baseman with two outs ends an inning. Back to the dugout. On May 27, Jávier Baez of the Chicago Cubs hit a ball just like that — but somehow, thanks to his daredevil base running and the Pittsburgh Pirates’ many blunders, he ended up at second base instead and allowed a teammate to score. It was the nuttiest play in Major League Baseball in 2021, if not of one of the wildest in baseball history.— James WagnerThis play, during the Nets’ 2020-21 regular-season finale against Cleveland on May 16, was a beautifully executed fast break. It started with Blake Griffin recovering a batted ball and twirling a one-handed, behind-the-back pass to Kyrie Irving at midcourt. Irving touch-passed the ball to Mike James, who had an open lane to the hoop. But instead of taking the layup, he threw a pass off the backboard for Kevin Durant to dunk home. It was a blend of excellent passing and showmanship, elements often on display when basketball is at its best.— Evan EasterlingEugénie Le Sommer is France’s career scoring leader and showed off her skill in a National Women’s Soccer League game on July 31. With precise footwork, she made her way into the penalty area, dropped Racing Louisville F.C. defender Emily Simon to the grass with two quick cutbacks and curled a shot into the far corner for her team, OL Reign.— Evan EasterlingOne of hockey’s rarities is the lacrosse goal, when a player standing behind the opponent’s net bends low to the ice and uses the blade of the stick to scoop the puck, cradle it and tuck it past the unsuspecting goaltender. It’s also known as the Michigan, as in the university, because Mike Legg executed the maneuver in a 1996 N.C.A.A. tournament game against Minnesota during the Wolverines’ championship run.Trevor Zegras, a rookie forward for the Anaheim Ducks, put his own twist on it this month against the Buffalo Sabres. Instead of going for the goal, he lofted a pass to Sonny Milano, who batted the puck past goalie Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen in hockey’s version of the alley-oop.— Evan EasterlingOne of the most anticipated events of the Tokyo Olympics was the women’s 400-meter hurdles. Frequently, when Sydney McLaughlin and Dalilah Muhammad, both of the United States, meet on the track, the winning time sets a world record. The trend continued this summer, when both McLaughlin and Muhammad broke the world record — which had belonged to McLaughlin — in the final of the event. McLaughlin won the race in 51.46 seconds, beating Muhammad by 12-hundredths of a second.— Talya Minsberg“I always say that the perfect race doesn’t exist, but this is the closest I’ve come to a perfect race,” Karsten Warholm of Norway said after the final of the men’s 400-meter hurdles in Tokyo. Warholm shattered his world record, winning in 45.94 seconds, to beat Rai Benjamin of the United States, who also broke the world record but was left with a silver medal. Five runners behind them set national records.— Talya MinsbergDiego Schwartzman, one of the quickest men in tennis, made the tweener look passé in Paris last month with this superbly disguised, no-look lob winner past Marcos Giron of the United States.— Christopher ClareyTampa Bay defenders swarmed him, and Patrick Mahomes fled. This happened all throughout the Super Bowl, and on a fourth-and-9 early in the fourth quarter, it was happening again. But still, he persisted, contorted, concocted. It was the best throw of the game, of the N.F.L. playoffs, of darn near the last calendar year — and it fell incomplete. But it sure wasn’t Mahomes’s fault.— Ben ShpigelThis moment of brilliance on Oct. 27 started inauspiciously. Portland’s Santiago Moreno sent a leading pass ahead of his teammate Dairon Asprilla but Asprilla couldn’t run down the ball. It bounded, seemingly harmlessly, off the turf at the Timbers’ Providence Park and headed for the hands of San Jose goalkeeper J.T. Marcinkowski. But instead of collecting the ball, Marcinkowski mishandled it. That allowed Asprilla to gain control, pop the ball into the air with his back to goal and score an acrobatic shot from outside the penalty area.— Evan EasterlingNo doubt, her waterfall of tears and shared joy after winning helped make this an Olympic moment. But let’s pause and appreciate Tamyra Mensah-Stock’s athleticism in becoming the first Black woman to win gold in wrestling. The top seed in the 68-kilogram freestyle final, she defeated the second seed, Blessing Oborududu of Nigeria, 4-1, after two takedowns in the first period. (Oborududu became the first Nigerian to win a medal in wrestling.) Mensah-Stock’s performance, strength and strategy, all in powerful harmony, were in keeping with her dominating march in the sport that only seems likely to continue.— Randal C. ArchiboldThe most magnificent goal scored during the 2021-22 N.H.L. season has already happened. On Nov. 5, late in the third period of a tie game against the Rangers, Connor McDavid, the center and human highlight reel for the Edmonton Oilers, collected a rebound off the boards, dipsy-doodled at the top of the zone for a bit, then stick-handled his way down the middle through four Rangers players as if they weren’t even on the ice before slipping the puck past goalie Alexandar Georgiev. It seemed to unfold in slow motion, and demanded repeated viewings, each one revealing a nuanced bit of innate hockey genius. Coming off a season for the ages, McDavid keeps outdoing himself. Oilers forward Zach Hyman called it the best goal he had ever seen. Us too.— Shawna RicherRobert Finke’s uncanny ability to find a second gear in the pool resulted in two surprise gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics. Finke, a first-time Olympian, won the men’s 800-meter freestyle with a stunning comeback in the last 50 meters. (Watch him in Lane 3 at the four-minute mark in the video.) Then he won the 1,500 free with another surge on his final turn. The performances left everyone — his opponents, his coaches, even Finke himself — stunned. “I didn’t know I had these swims in me,” he said.— Andrew KehI like speed and power as much as the next sports reporter, but I really like smarts, style, poise and any evidence that a player is operating on some higher cognitive plane. In April, Bruno Fernandes showed all of that without touching the ball, instead allowing it to pass through his legs — a bit of misdirection called a dummy in soccer terms — and thus free an onrushing teammate to score a relatively simple goal. I especially liked how, as Manchester United was celebrating, Mason Greenwood looked at Fernandes and tapped his head three times in appreciation.— Andrew KehNovak Djokovic won this epic U.S. Open semifinal, but Alexander Zverev won the rally of the year: going for it and converting on the 53rd shot.— Christopher ClareyNoteworthy moments in distance running exist only in retrospect. When the decision is made to set out at a world-record pace, or to break away from the pack, or to alternate surging with jogging to break an opponent, success is measured many minutes and miles later. Eugene, Ore., was so blistering hot in late June that the organizers of the U.S. Olympic track and field trials moved the women’s 10,000-meter race to the morning, when it would be “only” 85 degrees, and humid. No matter to Emily Sisson, who decided about six minutes into the race to move to the front and break the field by slowly ramping up her pace. She did so handily, winning by an unheard-of 1 minute 13 seconds. Sisson set a U.S. Olympic trials record in a race that was so brutal that four competitors did not even finish and the third-place finisher had to be hospitalized and did not remember the final few laps.— Kevin DraperThis video, which accompanied my article in January about Kai Jones, a 14-year-old daredevil pro adventure skier, was easily the most jaw-dropping sports performance I saw this year (or last). Jones’s verve, athleticism and fortitude amount to visual proof of the youth movement that is rewriting the limits of what used to be called out-of-bounds skiing. Don’t be surprised if you sometimes have the urge to cover your eyes as you watch.— Bill PenningtonTrick plays are amazing when they work. They are disastrous when they don’t. This one didn’t work.Trailing by 5 points inside the final two minutes of the game, Virginia needed a touchdown to take the lead against its in-state rival Virginia Tech in their showdown last month. On third-and-7, the Cavaliers went for a deep cut in the playbook, a backward pass to a lineman that ostensibly should have shocked the defense. The Hokies made the tackle for a loss, got a fourth-down stop, beat Virginia for the 17th time in their last 18 matchups and gained bowl eligibility.— Evan EasterlingThe most memorable highlight isn’t always a good one. Anastasiia Galashina of Russia was one of the final two competitors in air rifle at the Tokyo Olympics. After a long run of scoring 10.8s and 10.7s — 10.9 is the maximum — she had the lead with one shot remaining. That shot (at 1 minute 45 seconds in the video) was nowhere near the center of the target: a terrible 8.9, her worst shot of the competition. She fell from first to second in an instant, with Yang Qian of China winning the gold.— Victor Mather"
12,"Step Aside, LeBron and Dak, and Make Room for Banjo and Kazooie",,"Published Dec. 19, 2021","FRISCO, Texas — A miniature basketball hoop hangs from the bedroom door. Soccer trophies are prominent on the dresser. Each sport competes for the time and attention of David and Matthew Grimes. But both are losing ground to another staple of adolescence: the video game console.David, 13, and Matthew, 11, are fledgling e-sports athletes.David thumbs his controllers and listens to strategy talk from a YMCA coach on Monday nights. On Wednesday, he takes on all comers. Matthew has league play on Thursday. At least one weekend a month, they compete in a Super Smash Bros. Ultimate tournament.David and Matthew are part of a surging migration among members of Generation Z — as those born from 1997 to 2012 are often labeled — away from the basketball courts and soccer fields built for previous generations and toward the PlayStations and Xboxes of theirs.It’s not a zero-sum game: Many children, including the Grimeses, enjoy sports both virtual and physical. But it’s clear that the rise of e-sports has come at the expense of traditional youth sports, with implications for their future and for the way children grow up.E-sports got a boost, especially at the grass-roots level, during the pandemic. Between at-home learning and the shutdown of youth sports, a high-tech generation found even more escape and engagement on its smartphones and consoles.Participation in youth sports was declining even before Covid-19: In 2018, only 38 percent of children ages 6 to 12 played team sports on a regular basis, down from 45 percent in 2008, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association.In June 2020, the pandemic’s early days, 19 percent of parents with kids in youth sports said their child was not interested in playing sports, according to a survey conducted by The Aspen Institute’s Sports and Society Program. By September 2021, that figure was 28 percent.On average, children play less than three years in a sport and quit by age 11, according to the survey. Why? Mostly, because it is not fun anymore.The implications are global. There are currently more than 2.4 billion gamers — about one-third of the world’s population, according to Statista, an international marketing and consumer data firm based in Germany. There are professional teams around the world that compete in tournaments for prize pools up to $34 million as well as tens of thousands of other competitions with prize money or contested in school and recreational leagues, accounting for more than a $1 billion in global e-sports revenues.The effect on traditional sports is just one of the concerns often expressed about this phenomenon. The proliferation of e-sports conjures images of children eating sugary snacks late into the night as they stare at their screens. Research, however, doesn’t fully support this, with a 2019 German study finding only “a slight positive correlation” between gaming and body mass in adults, but not children.Some youth sports coaches seem to understand the spell video games cast over their players. In 2018, a lacrosse coach in New Jersey decided if he could not beat them, he’d join them. He gave a pregame talk that demonstrated his deep knowledge of Fortnite, and it ricocheted through social media.“This is just like Fortnite, just like Battle Royale,” he said. “Twenty-four teams, there’s four left. You know what? There’s four left, we’ve got Chug Jugs, we’ve got the golden SCAR. Let’s go! This is no different than a Fortnite battle. Let’s go win this, baby!”The waning interest in sports is hardly surprising when 87 percent of teenagers in the United States have iPhones, according to a survey of 10,000 young people by investment bank Piper Sandler, or when 26 percent of Gen Z youths named video games as their favorite entertainment activity, compared to 10 percent who chose watching television.“There is a lot more stuff competing for the attention of young people — e-sports is a big one,” said Dr. Travis E. Dorsch, associate professor and founding director of the Families in Sport Lab at Utah State University. “As kids get older, there is more tug at them academically and socially. We’re seeing a lot of dropouts. This creates a reckoning for youth sports.”The more than $19 billion youth sports industrial complex, with its private coaching, interstate travel and $350 baseball bats, shoulders some of the blame. Ten-month seasons in pursuit of a college scholarship in a single sport can mean that kids get yelled at by overzealous coaches and parents spend thousands of dollars on team fees and travel expenses.“We’re at an inflection moment of sports in America,” said Tom Cove, president and chief executive of the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, which compiles an annual report on participation in sports. “While families were at home during the pandemic, they did not have to drive their kids to practices four nights a week.“They liked it. They decided that there must be a better way.”For Tony and Dawnita Grimes, that way led them to the YMCA of Metropolitan Dallas and a greater appreciation for e-sports.Frisco, a city of 200,000 about 28 miles north of Dallas, is football country. It is home to The Star, the world headquarters of the Dallas Cowboys.David Grimes wears a Cowboys T-shirt and can tell you about the team’s quarterback, Dak Prescott. When The Star opened, David was chosen to carry the helmet of linebacker Leighton Vander Esch before a preseason training camp session.Tony Grimes is a sales executive with PepsiCo. He played high school football growing up in South Los Angeles. Dawnita Grimes, a lawyer, was on dance and tennis teams growing up in Kentucky.Tony and Dawnita Grimes steer their sons away football because of the risk of injury, but encourage soccer, swimming, basketball and golf. They want the boys to be well rounded, so David plays trumpet and Matthew piano. Sometimes the scramble of school, sports and other activities led to quick dinners or late starts on homework. The Grimeses were busy but adept at conducting the rhythms of family life.Then came the pandemic. The cancellation of games left the boys with time on their hands.“Because of Covid, I started to play video games,” David Grimes said.Little brother Matthew was right behind him.Their mother and father were immersed in their screens, too, and in a surrender familiar to many parents, were not as disciplined as usual about clocking the amount of time their boys were on their devices.“Oh yeah, it was a lifeline,” said Dawnita Grimes. “They were cut off from their friends. Most hadn’t exchanged numbers, or they don’t know each other’s last names. Unless you knew their parents, it was hard to connect, and I hate to say it, except through these games.”Tony Grimes admits that he likes picking up his boys’ controllers and trying to master another universe. Beyond the peace and quiet David and Matthew’s screen time afforded him, he had a new appreciation for the skills necessary to be competitive.“You have to be focused, understand strategy and have good hand-eye coordination,” he said.On a recent evening, David carried the game console downstairs so he could tell Matthew, his parents and a visitor what he had learned the previous night from the Y’s online tutorial. Both boys held their controllers gently, as if they were holding a bird.“It’s not enough to watch the games, you have to actually play them,” David said. “So you have to find a character that you’re good with.”“Get Hero or Cloud,” Matthew said as his brother clicked through characters.E-sports let kids have fun with their friends even when they’re not together. Audio headsets allow players to talk — or often scream — at one another as if they were sitting side by side. Anyone who has listened to their sons or daughters competing online has heard at least one side of conversation carried out as effortlessly as the cross talk between two basketball players on the playground during a game of HORSE.“The hierarchy you usually find in traditional sports is gone — everyone is just there,” said Dorsch, who was one of the lead investigators on the Aspen Institute research. “It’s more of a meritocracy.”He believes that e-sports have evolved that way because of the absence of adult influence at its introductory stage.“You go to a soccer or basketball program and you can tell immediately the 6-year-olds who are athletic and have talent,” Dorsch said. “Their parents see it and think, ‘Well, he or she could be really good with better coaching.’ ”For kids, that can turn a passion into a pursuit. A costly one, for parents.In a 2016 study, Dorsch and his colleagues found many households that spent as much as 10.5 percent of their gross income annually — sometimes $20,000 or more — on personal trainers, travel costs and private teams for their children.“Then it becomes about the adults in the room,” he said. “And they want a return on their investment.”In the Grimes family, the love of sports was handed down the traditional way. During one-on-one games on the miniature hoop hanging from the bedroom door, Tony Grimes was always Michael Jordan and David was LeBron James. It offered Tony an opportunity to tell the boys about a hero of his youth and how he compared to a hero of theirs.Now, those conversations are often reversed. Tony listens to David talk about why he prefers Banjo and Kazooie, Super Smash Bros. characters, over other game avatars. Instead of shooting percentages and scoring averages, the conversation is about B-button moves or side special ones that can mean the difference between victory and defeat.“So this is my favorite character, but I’m not great at playing him,” David said, conjuring a character named Hero onto the screen. “There are some characters that you really want to get good with. I’m not. Yet.”So, Banjo and Kazooie are more important to you than LeBron & Dak?“Pretty much, yeah,” David said, “because those are the characters I have to play with if I want to win a match or a tournament.”He has plenty of chances to compete. In April, the YMCA of America launched a national e-sports pilot in 120 of its U.S. branches. It was an immediate hit in the Dallas area, where more than 500 middle to high school age children have participated in its programs.“We knew how popular the games were and the fact that tournaments could be held remotely gave us a way to engage with kids during the pandemic,” said Rodney Black, program director for the YMCA of Metropolitan Dallas. “The interest was immediate and continues to grow. The plan is to have an on-site gaming lounge in 2022.”It was just the kind of mainstream recognition that persuaded Dawnita Grimes to open the online world a little wider for her boys.“You hear the stories about predators, and you worry about how addictive these games are,” she said. “Here, it is organized and supervised, and you don’t have to worry about bad language and poor sportsmanship.”David has won one tournament and Matthew beat his big brother in another. Still, neither has abandoned soccer and both are looking forward to tennis, golf and swimming in the spring and summer.David, however, knows there are professionals who have sponsors and can make millions in tournament play. You can almost hear the youth league football coaches pulling their hair out when he talks about it.“It’s safer than other sports. You don’t get hurt,” he said. “Well, you still have to worry about hands because if your hands get messed up, that’s a problem because you got to be able to play the game.”He pauses, then smiles.“It would be awesome to get paid to play video games.”"
13,"In Hiring Showalter, Cohen and Mets Send a Win-Now Message","The Mets opted for experience in their new manager, the latest acquisition in an off-season in which they have spent $254.5 million on veteran free agents.","Dec. 18, 2021","The Buck Showalter Experience pulled into Queens on Saturday, when the Mets became the fifth team to hire Showalter as manager. He has guided the Yankees, the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Texas Rangers and the Baltimore Orioles for more than 3,000 games, but the dugout cannot always contain him.Once, before a game in Texas, Showalter met with a visiting television crew and told them how nice it felt to focus simply on managing. Then he talked about a potential trade the team could make. And a minor-league pitcher who needed to throw more changeups. And a way to change the pattern of the grass at the Rangers’ ballpark, so outfielders’ throws would skip faster to the plate.“That was amazing,” said Steve Phillips, who was part of that broadcast crew. “He just got done saying that he loved it there because all he had to do is worry about being the manager — and one conversation, he was the general manager, the farm director and head groundskeeper!”Phillips, a former Mets general manager, laughed and added: “But that’s the thing — he thinks about all that stuff, and he never stops thinking about it. So he’s constantly trying to find an edge, constantly trying to identify areas to get better.”Showalter, 65, has never won a pennant but is widely respected for his preparedness and attention to detail. A three-time winner of the manager of the year award — in 1994 with the Yankees, in 2004 with the Rangers and in 2014 with the Orioles — he got a three-year deal from the Mets and a welcome from their owner, Steve Cohen, who revealed Showalter’s hiring on Twitter on Saturday afternoon.The Mets plan to make a formal announcement of Showalter’s arrival on Monday, so team officials would not comment on the hire on Saturday despite Cohen’s tweet. But the team’s leadership was said to have been swayed not only by Showalter’s experience, but also by how closely he has stayed in touch with the game since last managing, with the Orioles in 2018.The Mets have hired more than a dozen data analysts under Cohen, investing heavily in modern information systems to supplement a manager’s instincts. Showalter, who most recently worked for MLB Network and the YES Network, will be expected to deal more closely with the front office than he has in past jobs. But he has never been afraid of new ideas.“The whole anti-analytics, old-school thing, that’s just kind of a category that maybe some people can run with, probably because of his age,” Ryan Flaherty, who played for Showalter in Baltimore and now coaches for San Diego, said by phone on Saturday.“But the truth is that a lot of these modern concepts in baseball are things I heard him talk about back in 2012. There isn’t more of an open-minded guy, in my opinion, in the way he sees not just the game, but everything going on throughout the day.”The other finalists for the job were much younger than Showalter: Matt Quatraro, 48, the bench coach for the Tampa Bay Rays, and Joe Espada, 46, the bench coach for the Houston Astros. But neither has managed in the majors, like the previous three managers the Mets had hired since replacing Terry Collins after the 2017 season.The Mets have managed only one winning season since then, combining for a 266-280 record for Mickey Callaway and Luis Rojas. The manager between them, Carlos Beltran, was fired before his first spring training for his role as a player in the Astros’ sign-stealing scandal. Given that history, the Mets had to make a different kind of choice.“Matt Quatraro, I heard, interviewed really well, and Joe Espada is going to be a really good manager, too,” said Jim Duquette, the SNY analyst and former Mets general manager.“But going into it, you already have this notion — rightly or wrongly, and certainly within your fan base — that a first-time manager doesn’t fit in New York. It’s not like you couldn’t do it, but there’d be a lot of hurdles to overcome and it almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. So you instantly go to the experienced-manager ledger, and Buck’s right at the top of that list.”Showalter led the Yankees and the expansion Diamondbacks to the playoffs, only to be fired by both teams a year before they won the World Series. He may have done his finest work with the Orioles, though; Baltimore led the American League in victories from 2012 through 2016 while reaching the playoffs three times despite rugged competition in the A.L. East.“The biggest thing, right away, is accountability,” Flaherty said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re the clubhouse guy, if you’re the guy parking the cars or if you’re Manny Machado — everybody is held accountable, and there’s a set of standards that people are going to be held to. He was the first manager I played for, so you kind of assume that’s the way it is everywhere. But it’s not as easy as people think.”Steering the Mets to a deep October run will not be easy, either, despite Cohen’s spending. Before the lockout, the Mets committed $254.5 million for four free agents: the starting pitcher Max Scherzer, infielder Eduardo Escobar and outfielders Mark Canha and Starling Marte. All will be at least 33 years old by opening day, and players rarely improve at that age.Yet while the Mets share a division with the World Series champion Atlanta Braves, no other N.L. East team won more than 82 games last season (the Mets were 77-85). Showalter can team Scherzer with Jacob deGrom at the top of his rotation, and Marte with Pete Alonso, Francisco Lindor and other standouts in his lineup.The mandate is clear, and the Mets hired the candidate best equipped to think of every possible way to fulfill it.“You have no excuses now, right?” Duquette said. “No excuses. The roster’s not perfect — they’re going to still spend money — but you can’t sit there and say, ‘Well, we didn’t spend the money to field a good team, we didn’t go and get the most experienced manager.’ You can’t fall back on those excuses now. It’s full speed ahead to the postseason. Postseason or bust.”"
14,The Arizona Coyotes and Their Long Journey to Nowhere,"The N.H.L.’s least valuable franchise, and its 26-season headache, won’t have a home as of June 30 after the City of Glendale said it would end their agreement.","Dec. 17, 2021","Over the last 26 seasons, the Arizona Coyotes have at times been bankrupt, ownerless, a ward of the N.H.L., the subject of relocation rumors, and, more recently, in a prickly relationship with the owners of their home arena. The team has long struggled to draw fans to its suburban rink, and it has never contended for the Stanley Cup, despite putting Wayne Gretzky, hockey’s “GOAT,” behind the bench for four seasons.This month, the Coyotes may have reached a nadir. Glendale, Ariz., threatened to lock the team out of Gila River Arena in the middle of its season because Alex Meruelo, the team owner, owed $1.3 million in unpaid state and city taxes and arena operating costs from last season.The City of Glendale, which was owed about $250,000 in taxes, had told Xavier Gutierrez, the Coyotes’ chief executive and president, that it would cancel the team’s business license if the total amount was not paid by Dec. 20.Ahead of the deadline, but not before the Arizona Department of Revenue put a tax lien against the Coyotes’ parent company, IceArizona Hockey L.L.C., Meruelo paid $1.3 million to state officials and ASM Global, the company that manages Gila River Arena for the city.On Dec. 9, the morning after the Coyotes received a letter from the city manager Kevin Phelps, the team released a statement blaming the unpaid bills on “human error.”However, the N.H.L.’s most persistent headache and, at $400 million, the least valuable of its 32 franchises, faces even bigger problems. The Coyotes will be without a home at the end of this season with no alternative in sight.Glendale, a suburb of Phoenix, has made it clear since August that it is tired of wrangling over unpaid bills. Phelps says the relationship between the team and the city is over when its lease expires on June 30, 2022.“We’re going to continue to work hard to protect the interests of our taxpayers,” Phelps said. “We will not hesitate using every mechanism and tool that we have if they are not meeting their end of the obligation. I hope that the N.H.L. and the team, in particular, know that when I say that they don’t think that I am bluffing.”He said that the Coyotes are current on their bills through December but will owe about $4 million by the end of June.“We decided we weren’t going to wait until the kids were out of high school to get the divorce,” he added.Relocation is a notion more than a practical solution. Quebec City and Houston have both been floated before as potential homes for the Coyotes. Both cities have arenas fit for the purpose. In Houston, the Toyota Center is owned by Tilman Fertitta, who also owns the Rockets of the N.B.A.“The Coyotes aren’t going anywhere,” Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the N.H.L., said last week after the league’s annual board of governors’ meeting wrapped up in Palm Beach, Fla. “They’re going somewhere else other than Glendale, but they’re not leaving the greater Phoenix area.”However, Bettman, who has long been intransigent on the subject, also said that he planned to meet with representatives of the Quebec government in January, but brushed aside questions.“Other than scheduling the meeting, I don’t know what the specifics are of what they want to talk about other than at 10,000 feet we can all figure that out,” he said.The Phoenix metropolitan population of almost five million is the 10th-largest in the United States, and the 11th-largest Nielsen TV market.Neither an N.H.L. spokesman nor Bill Daly, the league’s deputy commissioner, responded to emails seeking comment and further clarification of Bettman’s remarks. The Coyotes also declined to comment.Houston has long been rumored as a relocation site for the Coyotes, since its metro population is the fifth-largest in the U.S. with 7.1 million people. Fertitta spoke with Bettman in 2018 about acquiring an N.H.L. team but has not said anything recently. A Rockets representative did not respond to an email seeking comment from Fertitta.The price of an N.H.L. team has increased substantially since the Coyotes arrived in the desert for the 1996-97 season. The Nashville Predators paid $80 million to join the league as an expansion team in 1998. The Vegas Golden Knights paid $500 million in 2017, and it cost the Seattle Kraken $650 million to join the league this season.But relocation has long been seen as a solution to the Coyotes’ problems, since Richard Burke, the Coyotes’ original owner who moved the Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix in 1996, sold the franchise to the Phoenix real-estate developer Steve Ellman in 2001.Ellman was the first in a long line of underfinanced owners whose misadventures kept the team in the headlines for years. This included a stretch from 2009 to 2013 when the N.H.L. carried the team financially and then purchased it out of bankruptcy before selling it to another group with precarious finances.The team was also saddled with Ellman’s decision to reject an arena deal with the City of Scottsdale, next to Phoenix in the East Valley, where many of its wealthy fans lived. He instead went to the West Valley and Glendale, on the other side of Phoenix, and the small city of 250,000 paid most of the $220 million it cost to build the arena, which opened in December 2003. The city also let Ellman establish an entertainment district around the arena with sales-tax revenues supposedly paying down the arena cost.For the most part, fans in Scottsdale have failed to make the roughly 25-mile drive to Glendale.Meruelo, 57, bought a majority share of the team for $300 million in 2019. The California-based businessman is said to be a billionaire with interests in media, real estate and casinos, including the Sahara Las Vegas.But unpaid bills and other financial disputes piled up. In February, The Athletic detailed Meruelo’s ownership style, including cases of late contract payments to players, unpaid bills to vendors and strained relationships with corporate sponsors.Phelps said that his first meeting with Meruelo, several months after he bought the team, was prescient.“We hadn’t met more than two minutes when he looked at me and said, ‘We’re not going to pay you one more dollar to use that arena,’” Phelps said.At a meeting shortly after that with ASM, the arena management company, Phelps said Meruelo used much the same statement. Phelps came to believe, like others who did business with Meruelo and his company executives, that their style was to refuse to pay a bill and dare the creditor to sue.“It’s not just by happenstance,” Phelps said. “It may be built into the culture and value of the organization that they can wear a creditor down and negotiate a better deal.”It will cost a lot of money to keep the Coyotes in the Phoenix area. The goal of Meruelo and Gutierrez is to finance and build a $2 billion arena and entertainment district with hotels, restaurants, retail and residential components in the city of Tempe, which is on the east side of Phoenix, in time for the 2025-26 season.In the meantime, they must find an alternative arena while the Tempe project goes through the approval and building process. Alternative venues are either unsuitable or require millions of dollars to be brought up to N.H.L. standards.The Tempe site is on city-owned land and requires remediation of a large landfill site before it can be developed. Phelps thinks this could take as long as six years before the arena is ready.In the meantime, the Coyotes, currently the worst team in the N.H.L. with only five wins, need somewhere to play next season. Robert Sarver, who owns the N.B.A.’s Phoenix Suns, the W.N.B.A.’s Phoenix Mercury and their Footprint Center, the only major arena aside from Gila River, has rejected several approaches over the years about taking in the Coyotes.The hockey club has two choices, both expensive. They are talking to the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball about building a permanent ice rink at Chase Field. The logistics of placing an ice surface in a baseball stadium that seats 48,405 fans are awkward at best; ask the Tampa Bay Lightning.The other choice, suggested by the N.H.L., is to build a temporary structure in either the East Valley or West Valley.One thing is clear: the Coyotes will not remain in Glendale. Phelps wants a deal richer than the $500,000 the team currently pays in annual rent, but the city manager said he is more focused on the value the Coyotes bring.Once he realized Meruelo and Gutierrez were not interested in a long-term lease at Gila River, Phelps hired an economist to study the financial impact of the Coyotes on the arena.He said the economist found that Coyotes crowds were so small that they generated only about $12,000 per game in sales-tax revenue at the arena and the Westgate Entertainment District, much less than a crowd for a concert. The city was told if it added 15 to 20 major concert dates per year it would replace the revenue generated by the 41 Coyotes home games in the regular season.The average revenue per Arizona fan is $5, tied for lowest in the league with the Florida Panthers, according to Forbes. Compare that to the Edmonton Oilers, who have a league-leading $43 in revenue per fan.Considering the Coyotes’ lease, which has Glendale paying all utilities costs plus operating costs and free rent for the team offices, Phelps said, “what we saw was financially it would actually be better for the City of Glendale not to have the Coyotes as a tenant.”“They’re like a tenant in a commercial mall,” he said. “We wish them the best of luck but on June 30 we expect you to have all your belongings and boxes out of the house.”"
15,"A ‘Master of What He Does,’ Steph Curry Now Stands Alone",The Golden State superstar passed Ray Allen for the top-spot on the career 3-pointer list. And he did it in 511 fewer games.,"Published Dec. 14, 2021","It takes about a second and a half from the moment Stephen Curry releases the basketball until it reaches the hoop more than 22 feet away, a flicker of time that somehow feels frozen for an expectant crowd, for his defenders and teammates, for television viewers and front office executives.“Emotionally, he’ll take you on a journey,” said Bob Myers, the general manager of the Golden State Warriors. “And I’m not sure that exists for other players. It’s something to behold.”For 13 N.B.A. seasons, Curry has been cluttering box scores for Golden State, and on Tuesday, he became the N.B.A.’s most prolific 3-point shooter when he sailed past Ray Allen’s career record. The record-tying and record-breaking shots came early in the first quarter of a game against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden, with Allen in attendance and the crowd buzzing every time Curry touched the ball.At 33, Curry is assembling one of the best seasons of his career, and he has helped position Golden State atop the Western Conference as the team awaits the return of Klay Thompson.In the process, Curry continues to refashion the 3-point line as his personal canvas, and with each week that passes, his record-setting total will grow: 2,977 career 3-pointers and counting in 789 games. Allen’s previous record had come in 1,300 games.But beyond the gluttonous numbers is the artistry of an athlete capable of producing jolts of electricity whenever he lines up a long-distance jumper.“You can feel the frenetic kind of energy that he generates,” said Bruce Fraser, one of Golden State’s assistants. “And when he really gets going, you can see the ball spinning a little faster coming out of his hands, and the arc of his shot — it’s almost like a meteor shower. It’s a storm in the sky. And I’ve never felt that from anyone else.”Curry’s latest milestone comes as Golden State continues to stage its renaissance after having stumbled through the wilderness of two listless, injury-riddled seasons — struggles that made a onetime superpower appear mortal after five straight appearances in the N.B.A. finals, including three championship victories over LeBron James’s Cleveland Cavaliers.Curry has seldom, if ever, been more of a sensation. After he made nine 3-pointers and scored 40 points in a lopsided victory last month, he was serenaded with “M.V.P.” chants — which was no big deal, except that Curry was in Cleveland.“When 30 got going, he got going,” the Cavaliers’ Darius Garland told reporters, referring to Curry’s uniform number. “Nothing else you can really say.”That is debatable. Over the course of a recent 15-minute telephone interview, Myers compared Curry to art by Rembrandt and Picasso, the Hall of Fame baseball player Ken Griffey Jr., and the Golden Gate Bridge.Hyperbole from a member of the same organization? Perhaps. Then again, Allen Iverson has described Curry as one of his favorite players, Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal routinely use the adjective “Stephortless,” and social media spirals toward chaos whenever Curry goes on one of his molten flurries.Why? Because Curry does not merely shoot 3-pointers. No, he makes them with three defenders draped all over him like a cheap tablecloth. He beats buzzers and crushes hope. He drains 3s on the run and from the general vicinity of the food court. He smiles and dances and points and preens, turning each field-goal attempt into a telenovela.“He’s a master at what he does,” said the Nets’ Kevin Durant, a former teammate.After Curry broke Allen’s record on Tuesday, the two embraced.“I pride myself on shooting a high percentage,” Curry said. “I pride myself on that helping us win games. Now, I can pride myself on the longevity of getting to that number Ray set, hopefully pushing it to a number nobody can reach. I never wanted to call myself the greatest shooter until I got that record. I’m comfortable saying that now.”Fred Kast, who spent 57 years as the Warriors’ official scorer before he retired last season, was the person responsible for documenting all of the 3-pointers that Curry made at home games. Kast, 82, took his job seriously, which meant that he tried hard to block out the emotion of the crowd whenever Curry started doing Curry things.Now, as a fan watching the games from his couch, Kast has a bit of a different perspective. Because he can focus entirely on the action, his appreciation for Curry has only grown.“You find it surprising when he does what most players do with far more frequency,” Kast said, “which is miss.”Curry does have off nights. In a recent loss to the San Antonio Spurs, he shot 7 of 28 from the field and 5 of 17 from 3-point range. He showed up at practice the next day looking particularly determined, Fraser said. Curry concluded his workout the same way he always does: by attempting 100 3-pointers.“He made 93 of them,” said Fraser, who feeds Curry the ball as he moves around the perimeter.A friend recently asked Fraser how many passes he had thrown to Curry over the past eight seasons (without getting credited with any assists). Had it topped 100,000? At first, that total sounded absurd to Fraser, who joined Golden State before the start of the 2014-15 season, but then he crunched the numbers. As a part of his post-practice work, Curry typically takes between 300 to 500 jumpers. And there are morning shootarounds. And pregame warm-ups. The total, Fraser said, works out to nearly 200,000 passes — each season.“So I’m at well over a million,” Fraser said.At the same time, there is an Everyman aspect to Curry, said Rick Welts, who retired as the Golden State’s president after last season. Curry’s size — he is listed at 6-foot-2 and 185 pounds, which is almost Lilliputian by N.B.A. standards — makes him more identifiable to fans, Welts said. And while players like LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo cram games with high-flying feats, Curry has elevated the humble jump shot into something special.“I can’t relate to what it feels like when Giannis dunks a ball,” Welts said. “But I can go out in my driveway right now and at least get a sense of what it feels like when Steph makes that shot.”Fellow 3-point shooters, past and present, say they take vicarious pleasure in Curry’s pyrotechnics. They know what it feels like to shed a defender, find the 3-point line and let the ball fly.“It’s an adrenaline rush every time,” said Chelsie Schweers, 32, who set the record for career 3-pointers among Division III women’s players during her career at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va. “There’s nothing like draining a step-back jumper. It’s my favorite thing on Earth.”Schweers, who made 415 3-pointers at Christopher Newport while shooting 46.1 percent from deep, has considered Curry her favorite player since he was emerging as a mid-major college star down the road at Davidson. At 5-foot-7, Schweers said she could relate to Curry since they were both relatively undersized. And they both could shoot.“He just brings so much joy,” said Schweers, who has spent the past 10 years playing overseas, most recently in Portugal.In 2004, ahead of his senior year of high school, John Grotberg went on a recruiting visit to Davidson. But after he sustained a knee injury, Grotberg opted to go the Division III route and enrolled at Grinnell College in Iowa. It turned out for the best: Grotberg wound up making more 3-pointers than any men’s player in N.C.A.A. history, and the backcourt at Davidson would have been crowded.“Steph was a year behind me,” Grotberg said.Grotberg, 34, went on to play in Europe before he studied medicine at Yale, and is now a physician in St. Louis. Now more than ever, Grotberg said, he appreciates his tangential connection to Curry, citing the 3-point record that he still owns, he said, only because Curry left Davidson a year early for the N.B.A.Grotberg continues to marvel, along with countless other basketball fans, at how Curry has transformed the game by stretching the court beyond comprehension. For a shooter, it is the stuff of dreams.“You get into this repetition where your body knows what to do,” Grotberg said, “and all you need to do is find the space to do it.”Curry has spent the past 13 seasons carving out that space. Now, on a stage of his own creation, he is there alone."
16,"Bryce Young, Alabama’s Sophomore Star, Wins the Heisman Trophy","Voters have more data points than ever to consider, but how they select the winner has changed little over the years: Quarterbacks dominate and winning matters.","Dec. 11, 2021","For this year’s 928 Heisman Trophy voters, the instructions were as straightforward as ever: Select as many as three candidates for college football’s most outstanding player.The news media members (145 in each of six geographic regions) and former Heisman winners (58 currently living) who submitted their votes electronically by 5 p.m. on Monday were not told to consider how valuable a player had been to his team’s success, to consider whether a player had played at the highest level — an Oberlin College player is just as eligible as one from Oklahoma — or to value one position or side of the football over another.There was no suggestion that academic prowess, community involvement or questions of moral turpitude should be part of the equation.Just select the most outstanding player.Yet, while voters in the information age have more data points than ever to consider, how they select the Heisman Trophy winner has changed little over the years: Quarterbacks dominate, winning matters, and the body of work must be buttressed by a Heisman moment, the more viral the better.So it was again on Saturday night as quarterback Bryce Young became the second consecutive Alabama player — and the fourth in the last 13 seasons — to win the Heisman Trophy, finishing comfortably ahead of the other finalists who had been invited to New York: Michigan defensive end Aidan Hutchinson, Pittsburgh quarterback Kenny Pickett and Ohio State quarterback C.J. Stroud.Consider that Young, a precocious sophomore who played behind an often leaky offensive line and delivered a sterling performance in Alabama’s upset of Georgia last Saturday in the Southeastern Conference title game, may not even be the best player on his team. That honor has been bestowed by many upon Will Anderson, a menacing pass rusher who leads the nation with 32½ tackles behind the line of scrimmage. (Anderson finished fifth in the voting.)The same could be said of Stroud, a freshman quarterback who, after some early struggles, directed the top offense in the country, which is built around a trio of elite receivers who repeatedly make themselves open. Pickett, a senior, put up similar video-game numbers and could certainly make a claim for having influenced the game: The fake-slide-and-touchdown-run play he used in the Atlantic Coast Conference title game was outlawed within a week.Hutchinson, who has 14 sacks — including three of Stroud in Michigan’s win over Ohio State — is only the third defensive player to finish among the top four since another Wolverine, Charles Woodson, became the only defensive player to win the Heisman in 1997. Notre Dame’s Manti Te’o also finished second, in 2012.Still, for one of American sports’ most cherished awards, there has been little evolution in how selectors make their choice. Over the last decade or so, more sophisticated statistical analysis has dramatically changed how baseball awards are determined, with old standbys like batting average and pitcher wins diminished in favor of other metrics that may even take ballparks into account.And in basketball, points and rebounds have been put into greater context to detail the efficiency with which they were compiled.“The guys who are inefficient and put up highlights, it was easier to make a case for them 10 years ago,” said Ryan Jones, a former editor of SLAM magazine, noting that high-volume shooters, like Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant, would be appraised somewhat less favorably today.“You don’t have to be a hard core analytics guy to appreciate Steph Curry, or what Jokic has done — or Giannis,” he added, referring to the N.B.A.’s best shooter and its past two most valuable players, Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo, both of whom have well-rounded games. “Some of it is real obvious, but the advanced stats sometimes tell you in a different way how impressive some of that stuff is.”There has been an even greater reconsideration in baseball.In 1990, Bob Welch, who posted a 27-6 record for the Oakland Athletics, won the American League Cy Young Award, comfortably outdistancing Roger Clemens, who was 21-6 for the Boston Red Sox. But Clemens registered a league-best 10.4 in wins above replacement, or WAR, a more recent metric that evaluates a player’s value to the team based on more detailed data. Welch, who recorded far fewer strikeouts and allowed far more home runs, had a modest 2.9 WAR, the lowest among the top seven vote-getters that season.Nowadays, wins have been so devalued in favor of other measures that Jacob deGrom won back-to-back Cy Young Awards for the Mets while compiling a pedestrian 21-17 record over the 2018 and 2019 seasons.A more nuanced lens has also changed how baseball Hall of Fame voters have given new life to candidates like Tim Raines, Edgar Martinez and Larry Walker who were passed over because they fell short of milestones like 3,000 hits, 500 home runs or 300 victories.“They’ve been on the ballot for a long time, but they got put over the top by voters looking at the new metrics and giving them more weight,” said Ryan Thibodaux, who tracks Hall of Fame voting as writers have made their ballots public. “The younger voters rely on those metrics more than the old-school voters do.”Football has taken longer to catch up to other sports in using data to explain performance. Of course, numbers have been part of the fabric of baseball as long as the box score has existed, and tracking of point totals has always been elemental to basketball. Metrics that might better explain offensive line performance or the playmaking ability of a linebacker or the context of a quarterback’s performance in today’s game are far from a common currency.Anthony Treash, who analyzes college football players for Pro Football Focus, said the Heisman Trophy — like other awards — had essentially become a team award. His message to voters: Go beyond the box score and what you see on the internet.“I don’t want to question the voter’s credibility, but do we really have the best information to know who the best players are?” he said. “Keep your mind open to new ideas in player evaluation.”Until that happens, players like Iowa center Tyler Linderbaum, who was given the highest grade for a Power 5 conference center in eight years by Pro Football Focus, or Cincinnati cornerback Ahmad Gardner, who allowed 96 receiving yards in 12 games — almost all of it in press coverage — or Alabama’s Anderson will have to watch the Heisman ceremony from home.And the rare defensive player, like Michigan’s Hutchinson, who does earn an invitation to New York will have to be content with using his front-row seat to applaud the winner."
17,Sports in 2021 Tried to Return to Normal,"The coronavirus pandemic still had an impact, but players and leagues had their moments.","Published Dec. 10, 2021","Leave it to a couple of old guys to remind us that sports can not only be a thing of beauty but also be enjoyed guilt-free and outside spectator-less bubbles. We needed some relief from the pandemic this year, and that’s exactly what Tom Brady and Phil Mickelson offered as the calendar flipped to 2021.In February there was the 43-year-old Brady at the Super Bowl — again — but with a new team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bullying the Kansas City Chiefs with pinpoint passing and outsize swagger. Sixty minutes of football later: Bucs 31, Chiefs 9, and Brady had earned his seventh championship ring.It was a home game. Sort of.But instead of a stadium packed with the Bucs’ faithful, it was played before a scaled-down crowd of around 25,000 — a third of them health care workers, which was both a fitting tribute to their heroics as well as a reminder that sports were being played very much in the shadow of the coronavirus.Three months later, on a late May afternoon in South Carolina, Mickelson, 50, defied Father Time while hundreds of fans joyously marched alongside him on the final fairway of the P.G.A. Championship. So much for social distancing.Two putts later, Lefty, as Mickelson is known, became the oldest golfer to win one of golf’s four major tournaments.“I’ve never had something like that,” said Mickelson of the rolling mosh pit that escorted him to the final hole. “It was a little bit unnerving but it was exceptionally awesome, too.”We all could relate as sports lurched back to life through 2021 after games in 2020 were played in “bubbles” or canceled altogether. In February, the Australian Open took place under an extreme lockdown. By late August, the United States Open unspooled before packed houses.The Covid-19 vaccination wars raged throughout the year. Depending on your point of view, superstars like Kyrie Irving (N.B.A.), Aaron Rodgers (N.F.L.) and Novak Djokovic (ATP) were either iconoclasts for refusing to get vaccinated or dire threats to public health.Leave it to a pair of young women, however, to bring the importance of athletes’ mental health off the sidelines and into center court and onto the Olympic mats.Naomi Osaka, 24, withdrew from the French Open after being fined $15,000 for skipping the news conference after her first-round victory. She was then threatened with the possibility of disqualification or suspension by all four Grand Slam tournaments if she continued to avoid the media.Instead, she pushed back.“I’ve often felt that people have no regard for athletes’ mental health and this rings very true whenever I see a press conference or partake in one,” she wrote in an Instagram post.She earned the support of Serena Williams.“Girl, do you. Your life is yours to live!” wrote Williams, who has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles.So, Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion, skipped Wimbledon altogether. Her loss in the third round of the U.S. Open ended her chances to defend her 2020 title.Now what?“Basically, I feel like I’m at this point where I’m trying to figure out what I want to do, and I honestly don’t know when I’m going to play my next tennis match,” a tearful Osaka said after the match.At the Tokyo Olympic Games, Simone Biles, 24, withdrew from the team final and the all-around competition after admitting to a mental block that gymnasts call “the twisties.” Considered one of the greatest gymnasts of all time, Biles performed a watered-down vault during the team competition.“Literally cannot tell up from down,” she wrote in an Instagram story. “It’s the craziest feeling ever. Not having an inch of control over your body.”Before the Games, Biles, a seven-time Olympic medalist, including four golds, acknowledged that she was feeling the pressure to succeed. She later explained that she drew strength from Osaka’s choice to take care of herself rather than chase medals.Biles did stay alongside her teammates and offered full-throated support as the Americans earned a silver medal behind the Russian Olympic Committee team. She was on hand, too, when Sunisa Lee won gold in the women’s all-around competition.Lee, 18, arrived in Tokyo wanting to win a gold medal for her father, who is her biggest fan, and for all the Hmong Americans who she feels are unseen in the United States. She said publicly, however, that a silver to Biles was more realistic.But with her teammate out, Lee showed she was up for the challenge.Biles, too, left Tokyo with an achievement. She returned to competition in time for the balance beam, earning a bronze with a scaled-down routine to tie Shannon Miller for most Olympic medals by an American gymnast.The fact that the Tokyo Olympics happened at all was a milestone. It was delayed a year and international spectators were not allowed to attend. The stadiums and arenas were largely television studios.The home team was rewarded mightily when Japan beat the U.S. team, 2-0, in women’s softball, which back in the Olympics for the first time since 2008. Yukiko Ueno, 39, was just as dominating on the pitcher’s mounds as she was in Beijing when Japan prevailed over the United States in that gold medal game.The U.S. women’s soccer team, ranked No. 1 in the world, was expected to follow up their 2019 World Cup title with an Olympic gold medal. Instead, they were defeated by Canada, 1-0, in the semifinals and later settled for bronze. Even one of the team’s most celebrated stars acknowledged it was an end of an era.“I was just gutted,” said Carli Lloyd, 39, a two-time gold medalist and the oldest player on the team. “We wake up early. We train late. We sacrifice. We give up so much, and you want to win. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you don’t. It’s just heartbreaking, really.”There were a couple of other notable losses during the sports year. Daniil Medvedev upset Djokovic in final of the U.S. Open, ending the Serbian’s quest to sweep tennis’ Grand Slam — a feat accomplished only by Rod Laver.Hank Aaron, who faced down racism as he eclipsed Babe Ruth as baseball’s home run king, hitting 755 home runs and holding the most celebrated record in sports for more than 30 years, died. He was 86.Then, there’s a victory that might turn into a loss.The trainer Bob Baffert appeared to win a record seventh Kentucky Derby when Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first. A week later, it was revealed that the colt had tested positive for a prohibited corticosteroid. Medina Spirit died on Dec. 5 after an apparent heart attack following a workout at the Santa Anita Park racetrack in California.Baffert has been barred from Churchill Downs and Derby for the next two years. That result has been contested in state and federal courts and will be for perhaps years to come. If the failed test is upheld, Medina Spirit will be disqualified and the second-place finisher Mandaloun will be declared the winner.For the first time in its 61-year history, the European soccer championship was played on a continentwide basis. It, too, was delayed by a year. Big players competed before small crowds in 11 cities — some as far apart as Seville, Spain, near the southwest tip of the Iberian Peninsula, and Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, nestled on the Caspian Sea.Italy beat England in a penalty shootout to win the championship, dashing England’s hopes of winning its first major title since the 1966 World Cup. The shootout was a dramatic conclusion to a gripping day at London’s Wembley Stadium. It was redemption for an Italian team that was humiliated four years ago when it failed to qualify for the World Cup.International athletes captured some significant American titles. Hideki Matsuyama won the Masters, becoming the first Asian-born man to do so. When asked if he was now the greatest in Japanese history, Matsuyama demurred.“I cannot say that I am the greatest,” he answered through an interpreter. “However, I’m the first to win a major, and if that’s the bar, then I set it.”Jon Rahm of Spain won the U.S. Open and his first major tournament at Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego, sinking two birdies on the final two holes. He dedicated his win to a fellow countryman, Seve Ballesteros, who died in 2011. His victory came two weeks after he was forced to withdraw from the Memorial Tournament because of a positive Covid-19 test. At the time, he was in the clubhouse after the third round with a six-shot lead.Rahm was philosophical about finding some good in the tenuous position the pandemic has put many of us in.“I was never resentful for anything for any second, and I don’t blame anybody,” he said. “Unfortunately, Covid is a reality. We have lost a lot of people. People said it wasn’t fair, but it was what had to be done. And all of it led to this moment.”And Giannis Antetokounmpo, nicknamed the Greek Freak, whose gentle ways have made him a folk hero in Milwaukee, led the Milwaukee Bucks to a N.B.A. championship. The 26-year-old Antetokounmpo was a jubilant winner who put his team’s victory into a hopeful perspective fitting for a world that has been disrupted by the pandemic.“This should make every person, every kid, anybody around the world to believe in their dreams,” said a jubilant Antetokounmpo, who is also of Nigerian descent. “I hope I give people around the world from Africa, from Europe, give them hope that it can be done. Eight and a half years ago, before I came into the league, I didn’t know where my next meal would come from. My mom was selling stuff in the street.”"
18,"Darlene Hard, Strong-Willed Tennis Star Before Pro Era, Dies at 85","Hard, who was outspoken and independent minded, was the top-ranked American woman from 1960 to 1963.","Published Dec. 8, 2021","Darlene Hard, a sturdy and strong-willed Californian with a power game who won 21 Grand Slam tennis championships as one of the last stars of the amateur era, died on Dec. 2 in Los Angeles. She was 85.Anne Marie McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I., which inducted Hard in 1973, confirmed the death but did not give a cause.Hard flourished in the late 1950s and early ’60s, when tournament tennis was the domain of amateurs. Along with her, the women’s game featured stars such as Althea Gibson, Maria Bueno of Brazil, Margaret Court of Australia and a young Billie Jean King, all future Hall of Famers.Of the Grand Slam tournaments, Hard won the United States amateur titles in 1960 and 61 and the French title in 1960. She reached the United States finals in 1958 and 1962 and the Wimbledon finals in 1957 and 1959. She also won 13 Grand Slam championships in women’s doubles with eight different partners, and five in mixed doubles, often paired with Rod Laver.She was ranked No. 1 in the United States from 1960 through 1963, and No. 2 in the world in 1960 and 61.Gibson played with more power than many women before or since, and Bueno was noted for her grace. But Hard’s aggressive game — big serve, strong overhead and punishing volley — made her a winner. At 5 feet 5½ inches and 140 pounds, she found her main success on grass courts, where three of the four Grand Slam tournaments were played. (The French Open was, and still is, played on a clay surface).Hard was unusually outspoken at a time when most top players lacked the assertiveness that some display today. She once said of dominating Australian tennis officials: “They treat you not as a player but a puppet. Between tournaments, I was not asked to play in exhibitions — I was ordered to play in them. It was not ‘Miss Hard, would you mind playing?’ It was ‘Miss Hard, you will play.’”Hard belonged to four victorious teams in the Wightman Cup, the annual competition between British and American tennis players. She showed her independent-mindedness then, too, earning the irritation of the American team’s captain, Margaret Osborne duPont.In an official 1962 report, duPont called Hard a “disrupting element” and wrote,“She insisted on practicing her way instead of complying with the captain’s wishes and those of the other team members.”Hard took part in a match that made tennis history on July 6, 1957, when she lost in the final that made Gibson the first African American woman to win Wimbledon (by a 6-3, 6-2 score). Before the match, as is customary, both players curtsied to a young Queen Elizabeth II. Afterward, the queen spoke to them for a few minutes. Then Gibson, following protocol, backed away. An overly enthused Hard, however, in an eyebrow-raising breach of etiquette, turned her back to the queen and skipped toward the locker room.Darlene Ruth Hard was born on Jan. 6, 1936, in Los Angeles and grew up in nearby Montebello, Calif. Her father introduced her to football, basketball, baseball and softball. Her mother, a good amateur player, taught her tennis on public courts.After high school, Hard spent four years on the tennis circuit. Then, she later said, “I decided I didn’t want tennis for a life, so I went to college. I wanted to be in pediatrics. I guess I always wanted to be a doctor.”She went to Pomona College in California and in 1958 won the first intercollegiate tennis championship for women. She graduated in 1961.While at Pomona, Hard had a hitting session with a 13-year-old player who had demonstrated some promise: Billie Jean King.“Darlene Hard had a major influence on my career, as an athlete, teammate and friend,” King was quoted as saying on the Hall of Fame website.The two went on to play doubles together in 1963 in the first Federation Cup, the premier international women’s team tennis competition. King — for whom the cup is now named — recalled how they had overcome two match points to win the final, which she called a highlight of both of their careers.Hard returned to tennis after graduating and worked as a waitress between tournaments. In 1964, with only $400 in the bank, she turned professional and played on a South African tour with Bueno. She soon started giving tennis lessons in the Los Angeles area, leaving tournament play behind.But in 1969, the year after pros were accepted into major tournaments, she returned briefly to international competition, teaming with Françoise Dürr to play doubles at the U.S. Open. Down 0-6, 0-2 in the final, they rallied to capture the title, 0–6, 6–3, 6–4.Hard went back to teaching tennis and owned two tennis shops. One of her tennis students, the director of student publications at the University of Southern California, offered her a job in the office in 1981. She took the job and remained there for nearly 40 years.Information on her survivors was not immediately available.In “We Have Come a Long Way: The Story of Women’s Tennis” (1988), which King wrote with Cynthia Starr, Hard described her dedication to the sport.“I didn’t do it for money,” she said. “I was the last of the amateurs. I won Forest Hills and I got my airfare from New York to Los Angeles. Whoopee.” She continued: “But we still went for our titles. We went for the glory. I was happy. I loved it. I loved tennis.”"
19,A Baseball Man Who Was Best Viewed in Total,Gil Hodges struggled to make the Hall of Fame because voters had to consider him as a player or as a manager. Hodges was decidedly both and is finally headed to Cooperstown.,"Dec. 6, 2021","They were sons of the 1920s, Indiana teenagers when Brooklyn came calling. Gil Hodges, from Petersburg, was about three years older than Carl Erskine, from Anderson. One day, in 1950, they shared an afternoon for the ages: four home runs for Hodges and a complete game — with four hits at the plate — for Erskine. The pitcher was friendly with the slugger and his family.“I knew his brother and I knew his father,” Erskine said by phone from Indiana on Monday. “All three of those men died of the same heart condition. It was rare, but one of the biggest, strongest men on the team was Hodges, and yet his heart was not strong and it took him too early in life.”Hodges was just 47 when he died on Easter in 1972, in West Palm Beach, Fla., after a round of golf with his Mets coaches during spring training. Erskine turns 95 on Dec. 13, one of just two living Dodgers — with Roger Craig — who played for the winners of the 1955 World Series. Their candle is flickering, but their legend burns brighter now. Hodges is a Hall of Fame player.He made it on Sunday when a 16-person panel, at last, delivered a different verdict than all the others. Denied for 15 years by the writers, and again by several iterations of the veterans committee, Hodges will finally have a plaque in Cooperstown, N.Y.“It’s a great, great thing that happened for our family,” Gil Hodges Jr. said on Monday. “We’re all thrilled that Mom got to see it, being 95. This was perfect timing.”Joan Hodges, Gil’s widow, rode with him up Broadway in an open convertible in October 1969, ticker tape swirling like snowfall. That World Series triumph, as the manager of the Miracle Mets, was one of three for Hodges. He also helped the Los Angeles Dodgers win a championship in 1959, his last big year as a player.Hodges averaged 30 home runs and 101 runs batted in per season from 1949 through ’59. He hit 370 homers overall, and in May 1963, when Hodges retired, only two right-handed hitters (Jimmie Foxx and Willie Mays) had more home runs. Now there are more than 40 right-handers ahead of Hodges.His fielding also set him apart. Gold Gloves were first presented in 1957 — the Dodgers’ last year in Brooklyn and Hodges’ 10th full season — and Hodges claimed the first three. He did not win on name recognition, either.“A lot of first basemen are good with the glove; Ted Kluszewski, for instance, was an outstanding first baseman, but compared to Hodges he didn’t have the range,” Erskine said. “Gil could go broadly afield. He’d been a catcher at one time earlier, and so he was accustomed to fielding bunts out in front of home plate. He’d charge on a bunt, field the bunt, turn and have a catcher’s throw to second base and nail the runner. I never saw another first baseman who would even try that. But he was agile and he had great hands.”Hodges may have had the most massive hands in baseball. That is what Roger Kahn wrote in “The Boys of Summer,” at least, confirming it with this quip from shortstop Pee Wee Reese: “Gil wears a glove at first base because it’s fashionable. With those hands, he doesn’t really need one.”Hodges’ case for Cooperstown had long been perplexing. He was gaining momentum on the writers’ ballot before he died, then spent more than a decade in a holding pattern, with 49 to 63 percent of the votes. Historically, nearly every candidate to get that much support eventually gets in, but the committees had never nudged Hodges across the 75 percent threshold.The 1993 vote was especially cruel. Roy Campanella, Hodges’ wheelchair-bound Brooklyn teammate who would die that summer, could not attend the meeting in person and was not allowed to vote by phone. The family was crushed, at least in the moment.“That hurt a little different, because we had the 12th vote,” Gil Jr. said. “But you know what? When the day ended, everything was still the same. We just went and moved forward.”One problem for Hodges was that candidates are supposed to be judged on a playing or a managing career, not both. By strict interpretation, then, Hodges’ 1969 title with the Mets could not have pushed him over the borderline. But that achievement is integral to his story, and his players have long credited Hodges for skillfully using role players and insisting on a clean style of play.After the Mets beat Atlanta in the 1969 National League Championship Series, outfielder Cleon Jones recalled a couple of years ago, the Braves’ Hank Aaron warned a Baltimore scout that the favored Orioles might be in trouble.“If you don’t play the best baseball that you’ve played all year, you’re going to get beat,” Jones said, recalling Aaron’s message. “This is a good team, they don’t make mistakes and they do all the things that it takes to win.”Jones continued: “And I attribute that to Gil Hodges. Had it been anybody else — Yogi Berra or Wes Westrum or even Casey Stengel as the manager, you wouldn’t be talking about the ’69 Mets. We won because of our leader, which was Gil Hodges, because he instilled that kind of attitude in the ballclub and he didn’t allow us to make mistakes.”Hodges’ Brooklyn teammates did not expect him to manage, Erskine said, because he was so composed, never prone to tantrums — the opposite, in other words, of the Orioles’ Earl Weaver. A manager without a “forceful personality,” as Erskine put it, was somewhat rare.“But if you talk to somebody that played for him as a manager, like Tom Seaver with the Mets, he said, ‘Hodges was quiet, but he had a look that could burn your shorts off,’” Erskine said. “So if he gave you this look, he didn’t have to say anything. He was not a holler guy, but he gave you the look and you had the meaning of it already.”The Mets could not build on their championship under Hodges. They finished 83-79 in each of the next two seasons, placing third both times. Ed Kranepool, their first baseman, insisted Monday that the Mets would have won “many, many more pennants” had Hodges lived. But of course there is no way to know.It is a safe bet, though, that Hodges would have accepted his Hall of Fame election with understated grace, not wanting much of a fuss. He built a legacy and raised a family in New York, but he was Indiana, through and through.“Down-to-earth people — that was his background, the way he was raised,” Erskine said. “Humility was a part of his life. It came just as natural as breathing. So that was kind of his trademark, and it was a good one.”"
20,He Was a Black Star 60 Years Before Jackie. Now He’s a Hall of Famer.,"Elected by the Hall’s Early Days committee, Bud Fowler was a pioneer who played organized professional baseball against white players as early as 1878.","Published Dec. 6, 2021","Bud Fowler was far more than a curiosity.A professional player in the late 19th century, Fowler is considered by many to have been the first Black player to compete in organized baseball against white players. But many news media reports on his travels around various professional teams and leagues in those days made it clear that the two-way star, who pitched and played catcher in addition to his exploits as a fleet second baseman, was a player to be reckoned with regardless of his race.In 1882, The Times-Picayune in New Orleans noted that Fowler would be playing a game for a local team, the Pickwicks, and referred to him as “the celebrated colored curve pitcher of Lynn, Mass.”When the Lawrence Eagles were playing the Kansas City Novels in 1886, The Evening Tribune in Lawrence, Kan., mentioned that Fowler, “the phenomenal colored player of Topeka,” would be playing for the Eagles. And when Fowler was reportedly considering playing for a team out of Plattsmouth, Neb., in 1891, The Omaha Daily Bee endorsed the move, saying Fowler was “one of the best men in his position that can be found and would be a good acquisition to the team.”Words like “pioneer” and “trailblazer” are often used to describe Fowler, and on Sunday he added a new title: Hall of Famer. Fowler is part of a six-person class that was elected by a pair of committees asked to review players from baseball’s past. Of the six players, he has the least name recognition, but his exclusion has long been viewed as a mistake by baseball historians.While Buck O’Neil, a player and manager for the Kansas City Monarchs, and Minnie Miñoso, who played for the New York Cubans at the start of his career, were the first players from the Negro leagues to be elected to the Hall of Fame since 2006 — and the first to be elected since several Negro leagues were recognized by Major League Baseball last year as having been major leagues — Fowler’s career predated most of those organized Negro leagues. Much of it came before the white major and minor leagues effectively barred Black players in the late 1880s.Fowler helped organize teams and leagues of Black players, including the famed Page Fence Giants in Adrian, Mich., and was known to give scouting reports on Black players to teams looking for new talent. Official statistics are so sparse from his career that it is hard to paint a picture of him as a player, but reports from the time made it clear that he was among the game’s most talented players.Despite starring in several leagues that were predominantly white, Fowler encountered racism throughout his career from teammates, club leaders, local communities, hotels and restaurants.In 1887 he was playing in the International League, a top minor league that considered itself a rival of the National League, when multiple instances of players refusing to play with or against Black players — one of which was spearheaded by the Hall of Famer Cap Anson — resulted in that league formally barring Black players. That vote is seen by many as having established baseball’s racist “color line,” which held until Jackie Robinson was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers and then assigned to the Montreal Royals in 1946.The move to bar Black players in 1887 had nothing to do with ability. In the book “Only the Ball Was White,” the historian Robert Peterson discussed the barred International League players, saying, “Frank Grant, Bud Fowler and George Stovey were unquestionably of major league star caliber.”Fowler continued to play organized baseball until at least 1895, and he died in 1913. Most of his later life remains a mystery because he did not keep a diary or other papers to study. His grave in Frankfort, N.Y., went unmarked until the Society for American Baseball Research placed a memorial there in 1987.Fowler, who grew up in Cooperstown, N.Y., was honored by his home city in 2013 when it renamed a street “Bud Fowler Way.” And now, more than 100 years after his death, Fowler will receive baseball’s highest honor in a field just miles from where he grew up."
21,Baseball’s ‘Court of Appeals’ Adds Six New Hall of Famers,"A pair of old-timers’ committees corrected previous snubs, electing Buck O’Neil, Gil Hodges, Minnie Miñoso, Tony Oliva, Jim Kaat and Bud Fowler.","Dec. 5, 2021","Jim Kaat’s father, John, raised him on tales of his baseball hero, Lefty Grove, who defined pitching dominance in the years before World War II. When Grove was inducted to the Hall of Fame, in 1947, John Kaat made the pilgrimage to Cooperstown, N.Y., to see him.Jim Kaat would make many trips to Cooperstown, too, reveling in the chance to roam among legends. He played in the Hall of Fame Game in 1966, on the day Ted Williams and Casey Stengel gave their speeches, and returned through the years to honor teammates at their inductions — Harmon Killebrew, Mike Schmidt, Bruce Sutter and more.Now Kaat, at 83 years old, will have his own plaque in the gallery, as one of the six old-timers elected by a pair of committees that met on Sunday in Orlando, Fla. Kaat’s former Minnesota Twins teammate, Tony Oliva, also 83, was elected, too, along with Gil Hodges, Minnie Miñoso, Bud Fowler and Buck O’Neil.All of the candidates had been considered and passed over before, including Hodges, Miñoso and O’Neil while they were still alive. The path to the Hall can be arduous for some, and Kaat sounded almost sheepish about his place in a room reserved for the giants of the sport.“There’s got to be degrees of the Hall of Fame,” Kaat said. “I think they probably have a back row for me and I’ll wave to those guys up there. But it is pretty awesome to think of. I know when my career ended, Bowie Kuhn had told me it was the longest career for a pitcher in history.”Kuhn, a former commissioner of Major League Baseball, was right: Kaat’s career spanned 25 seasons and was the longest ever at his retirement in 1983. Nolan Ryan now holds the record for pitching seasons, with 27, along with the records for strikeouts and no-hitters. Ryan is one of those no-doubt Hall of Famers, the ones who took the express lane to immortality with a first-ballot induction by the writers’ vote.Dominance was not Kaat’s game. He had 180 complete games, won 16 Gold Gloves and went 283-237 with a 3.45 earned run average. But he is also the first Hall of Fame pitcher in the integration era (since 1947) to allow an average of more than a hit per inning (9.2 per nine). He spent most of his final five seasons as a situational reliever.“I never really was a perennial No. 1 pitcher,” Kaat said, mentioning Grove, Warren Spahn, Greg Maddux and more. “All of those pitchers were No. 1 pitchers. I evolved, some years, into a No. 1 pitcher, but I wasn’t the guy that just said, ‘You’re going to start opening day for 10 years.’ I understood that and I know a lot of people in the past, the writers, said it took him too long to accomplish what he did.”Candidates with splashier statistics — but far more complicated legacies — could join the 2022 class next month, when the Hall announces the results of the writers’ ballot, which includes David Ortiz and Alex Rodriguez for the first time, and Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling for the last. Players who are not elected by the writers can gain entry later through 16-person committees — or, as Bob Costas put it on MLB Network, “baseball’s court of appeals.”The makeup of the jury, whose individual votes are kept secret, can heavily influence the outcome. Harold Baines, a longtime Chicago White Sox star, was elected in December 2018 by a committee that included Chicago’s team chairman, Jerry Reinsdorf, and its former manager, Tony La Russa. Former teammates like Schmidt, Rod Carew and Ozzie Smith — and contemporaries like Fergie Jenkins and Joe Torre — probably helped Kaat’s case.“Whether it was exposure, being a broadcaster, that helped, I don’t know,” Kaat said. “I think what helped today was having players there I played with and against.”Hodges, the slugging first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers who guided the Mets to a championship as manager in 1969, nearly made it on the writers’ ballot. Candidates need 75 percent of the vote to be elected, and Hodges got 50 percent in 1971, the year before his death of a heart attack at age 47. Until Sunday, Hodges (who peaked at 63.4 percent) was the only player ever to get 50 percent on the writers’ ballot without eventually making it in.Miñoso, who died in 2015, never generated much attention from the writers but was finally recognized for a career that began in the Negro leagues and stretched to 1980, in a token appearance for his primary team, the White Sox. Miñoso, an outfielder, hit .299 with a stellar .848 on-base plus slugging percentage in nearly 2,000 games.Oliva is a native of Cuba, like Miñoso, and won the American League batting title in 1964 and 1965, his first two full seasons. A left-handed hitting outfielder, Oliva made eight All-Star teams, won three batting titles overall and hit .304 with an .830 O.P.S.“My family never had a chance to see me play in the United States,” Oliva said. “In Cuba I played very little, I only played every Sunday in the country. My mother, my father, my brother, they never saw me play. I wish they had the opportunity to be here today, but they’re in heaven right now, my father and my mother, they’d be very proud that their little country boy from Cuba is in the Hall of Fame today.”Fowler and O’Neil were elected by a different committee than the others, one that considered players whose contributions predated the integration era.Fowler, whose career began in the 1870s, was a pioneer in many regards who is considered by many to have been the first Black player to have played organized baseball against white players. O’Neil, a founder of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, was a star first baseman who spent decades around professional baseball as a manager and scout.O’Neil died at age 94 in 2006, the year the Hall of Fame admitted 17 members from the Negro leagues, but not him. The Hall created a special achievement award in O’Neil’s name, but has at last given him the highest honor of all."
22,"LaMarr Hoyt, Pitcher Whose Star Shone Brightly but Briefly, Dies at 66","He won the 1983 Cy Young Award as the American League’s leading pitcher, but an injury and troubles with drugs and the law ended his career prematurely.","Dec. 3, 2021","LaMarr Hoyt, the Chicago White Sox right-hander who coupled outstanding control with a fine sinkerball to win the 1983 Cy Young Award as the American League’s leading pitcher, died on Monday in Columbia, S.C. He was 66.The cause was cancer, his son Matthew said in a statement on the team’s website.Hoyt was a student of pitching.“What I learned to do, and it took all seven years in the minors, was to make the absolute most of the limited talent I had,” he told The New York Times in 1988. “I couldn’t ever blow hitters away, but I could put a ball where I wanted, a fourth of an inch, a sixteenth of an inch, and I could make the ball move. I knew how to attack the corners of the plate.”But despite his success, Hoyt’s pitching career ended prematurely. He was plagued by a shoulder injury and began abusing drugs, including painkillers. He was arrested several times, spent time in jail and was out of baseball in 1987.Hoyt led the American League in victories with 19 in 1982, his third full major league season. The next year, his Cy Young season, he posted a 24-10 record with a 3.66 earned run average and 11 complete games while walking only 31 batters over 260 ⅔ innings.He pitched a complete game in Chicago’s 2-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the opener of the 1983 American League Championship Series. Following that game, the Times sports columnist Dave Anderson wrote that while Hoyt was listed at 6 feet 2 inches and 220 pounds, he acknowledged weighing more than 240 and “on the mound, with his beard and his belly,” looked like “a Sunday softball pitcher who belongs in a beer commercial, rather than a Cy Young Award candidate in the American League Championship Series.”The Orioles won the next three A.L.C.S. games to reach the World Series, where they beat the Philadelphia Phillies.After the 1984 season, in which the White Sox finished in a fifth-place tie in the American League West and Hoyt’s record fell to 13-18, he was traded to the San Diego Padres. He rebounded in 1985 and was the starting pitcher and most valuable player for the National League in its victory over the American League in the All-Star Game. But he felt pain in his shoulder and was later found to have a torn rotator cuff.He finished the 1985 season with a 16-8 record, but he was continuing to pitch with pain. He became dependent on drugs and checked into a rehabilitation program early in 1986. He missed most of the Padres’ spring training and went 8-11 that season.His drug troubles continued. After several arrests on drug-possession charges, the Padres waived him in January 1987. Major League Baseball then suspended him for 60 days. The White Sox later re-signed him, but he was arrested again that December and did not pitch for them.In eight major league seasons, Hoyt had a 98-68 record with a 3.99 earned run average.Dewey LaMarr Hoyt Jr. was born on Jan. 1, 1955, in Columbia. His parents divorced when he was a year old. He was an all-around athlete in high school but, as he told The Chicago Sun-Times in 2001, he began using marijuana and having “beers with the boys” while a teenager.The Yankees selected him in the 1973 major league amateur draft and traded him to the White Sox system in April 1977, in a multiplayer deal that brought shortstop Bucky Dent to Yankee Stadium.Hoyt and his second wife, Leslie, had two sons, Matthew and Josh, and a daughter, Alexandra. His first marriage ended in divorce. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.After Hoyt’s baseball career ended, he sold sporting goods and household appliances.“I am not happy about the way I left things in baseball,” he told The Chicago Sun-Times in 2001, when he and his second wife were raising three children and life was good. “I need to right the wrongs I caused. Everybody who knew me will understand when I say I never will give up.”Tony LaRussa, who managed the White Sox during Hoyt’s years with them and is now in his second stint with the team, said in a statement upon Hoyt’s death: “My first impression of LaMarr was, ‘Here is a pitcher.’ He had average stuff but amazing command and tremendous confidence, and he never showed fear. What a great competitor.”"
23,M.L.B.’s Lockout: What Is It? How Does It Work? What’s Next?,Players are locked out and transactions are frozen in baseball’s ninth work stoppage. But no one is missing any checks — yet.,,"At 11:59 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, the document that governs baseball — the five-year collective bargaining agreement between the owners of the 30 Major League Baseball clubs and the players — expired. Two minutes later, M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that the league had enacted a lockout, which brought the sport to a halt. Teams are not allowed to talk to players, make major-league signings or swing trades.This is the ninth work stoppage in M.L.B. history, and the fourth lockout. Here is what’s going on:In short, it is a type of work stoppage used by the owners of a business during a labor dispute.“In a lockout, the management tells workers don’t show up,” said Bob Jarvis, a professor who teaches a baseball law course at Nova Southeastern University. “While in a strike, workers tell management, ‘We’re not going to show up.’ But either way, the factory or the business comes to a standstill because the workers are not there.”A lockout is a tool that owners can use. Leagues can operate without a new collective bargaining agreement in place, but it is common practice in the four major men’s North American professional sports leagues — M.L.B., the N.F.L., the N.B.A. and the N.H.L. — to use a lockout in instances like this.Manfred referred to M.L.B.’s implementation of the lockout as “defensive.” His reasoning: the 1994-95 strike — the last work stoppage in baseball to cost regular-season games (over 900 in all) — came after the league had continued to operate without a new agreement.When the C.B.A. expired then, the 1994 season began as scheduled. Players went on strike in August as M.L.B. sought to add a salary cap. The union successfully avoided the institution of the cap, but the 1994 World Series was canceled and the strike didn’t end until April 1995, with a legal battle playing out in public.“You want to control the timing of the dispute,” Manfred said, adding later, “If you play without an agreement, you’re vulnerable to a strike at any point in time. What happened in 1994 is the M.L.B.P.A. picked August when we were most vulnerable because of the proximity of the large revenue dollars associated with the postseason. We wanted to take that option away and try to force the parties to deal with the issues and get an agreement now.”Players felt as if owners had been planning a lockout for some time and that it was an attempt at intimidation.“It’s unnecessary to continue the dialogue,” said Tony Clark, the executive director of the players’ union. “We’ve obviously had 26 years without a work stoppage and the industry has continued to do well and grow. And at the first instance in some time of bumpy water, the recourse was a strategic decision to lock players out.”None yet.In the lockouts of 1973, ’76 and ’90, a full regular-season was played each time. In 1990, for instance, the 32-day lockout eliminated most of spring training, but 162 regular-season games were played, starting a week later than usual.Even though it is the off-season, Manfred conceded that a lockout is “bad for our business.” No games or paychecks are being missed over the winter, but Clark said players considered the lockout “provocative.”“The moment that you declare a lockout, you really push fans into the players’ camp,” Jarvis said. “You really play into the players’ argument that, ‘Hey, even though we’re the reason that you’re coming out to see the games, you won’t be able to see the games because of what management did.’ It is much better for management to force the players to go on strike so that management can say, ‘Hey, we want the games to go on. It’s the players who are refusing to show up.’”Jarvis said that, at least, this work stoppage was coming during a time when other sports are in season: the N.B.A., the N.F.L., the N.H.L., and college football. But for ardent baseball fans who intensely follow their team’s hot stove moves, he said a lockout is bad because the activity has stopped. For the average fan, he said, a lockout isn’t going to make a difference. That is, until spring training. If a new agreement is not struck by then, the casual fan will start to notice when the usual schedule is altered. More will when the regular season is affected.“Right now, the calendar favors ownership,” said Michael LeRoy, a professor and sports labor expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “Players can’t sign free-agent deals and they’re going to get anxious about that. But if players are able to hold fast through late January or February, now the advantage shifts to the players. It’s not very common, but there are times that lockouts convert to strikes. My concern about this is that a lockout would not be resolved quickly, and that in time it would morph into a strike and it would last into spring training and beyond.”LeRoy said there have been roughly 20 work stoppages in the four major North American sports leagues since the 1960s with almost all of them won by management. The lone exception: the 1994-95 baseball players’ strike.“That was the strike that set the bar for labor unions in sports to emulate and so that is framing everything here,” he said. “That was a spectacular success for the union that was so successful, because the union avoided a hard salary cap. And that’s why we have players signing 10-year deals for over $300 million. You have nothing like it in any other sport.”There are a lot.Although star players are setting contract records in a system without a hard salary cap — a mechanism present in the other major North American professional sports leagues — players feel owners aren’t struggling as much as they say they are; that too many teams are receiving tens of millions in revenue sharing from their counterparts yet purposefully aren’t competing for playoff spots; that the industry has grown but the average major-league salary (roughly $4 million) has remained flat or dropped; that younger, cheaper players are being relied on more than ever and having their service time manipulated.Owners, though, believe baseball players have the best deal in professional sports and point to this off-season’s free-agent spending, which was on pace to set a record, as one point in that argument.Read more about their dispute here, here, here and here.They cannot sign major league contracts. They cannot take part in team activities. They should not be talking to team officials. They cannot use team facilities. (A fair amount of players, though, already work out with private trainers or coaches in the off-season.)Some of the specifics of what players can do seems to be in dispute. Asked if contact between club officials and players undergoing rehabilitation for injuries or those talking to team mental health professionals could continue, Manfred said, “That’s a legal issue upon which we do not have flexibility.”Clark countered by saying “We have a difference of opinion in regard to what the rules of engagement are here. There have been differences in other scenarios whereby support was provided to those who needed it. So on that front, it is not a line in the sand that is necessary to draw.”On Thursday morning, Yankees pitcher Jameson Taillon, who is recovering from ankle surgery in October, tweeted that he was going to have to find his own way to continue his rehabilitation.“Since MLB chose to lock us out, i’m not able to work with our amazing team Physical Therapists who have been leading my post surgery care/progression,” he wrote. “Now that I’m in charge of my own PT- what should my first order of business be? I’m thinking I’m done with this boot. It can go.”The union has told players that, if they were on a 40-man roster at any point during the 2021 season, their medical benefits will continue until the scheduled start of the 2022 season, according to a work stoppage guide provided to agents, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. If a work stoppage continues after then, the union said it will use its reserves to cover their health benefits.Teams were expected to continue their off-seasons but without a major component: the players. They can work on trades but cannot consummate them. They can continue working with their non playing employees, scouring video, planning their strategies and so on.An M.L.B. spokesman said that “for the foreseeable future, there are no plans at the league or club level to implement furloughs, pay reductions or work force reductions” while M.L.B. negotiated what it hoped would be “a full 2022 season” with the union.In 2020, when the pandemic halted everything in spring training and negotiations over a regular season lasted months, many clubs furloughed or laid off employees, and instituted pay cuts.Yes. They said they planned to, even though no further sessions had been scheduled as of Thursday morning.“There’s this intense negotiation and then when the lockout occurs, there’s emotion around it and people back away,” LeRoy said. “And usually there’s a fairly lengthy hiatus before any more talks occur. It wouldn’t surprise me if it was weeks later that talks occur. And really, what it becomes is a war of attrition. Who can endure the pain the longest?”After the C.B.A. expired, neither Manfred nor Clark provided a deadline for a deal. Manfred said M.L.B. enacted the lockout now to provide enough time to reach a resolution that avoids damaging the 2022 season. Clark said players want an agreement that addresses their concerns and hoped it would be “sooner rather than later.”Not yet.Players don’t earn paychecks or service time in the off-season or spring training, during which they get allowances. Paychecks and service time start in the regular season, which is slated to begin on March 31. (During a lockout, according to the union, clubs are obligated to pay any signing bonuses, deferred salary and any other payments that were earned before the lockout began.)"
24,"At Jackson State, the ‘Prime Effect’ Reverberates","In his first full season as the football coach, Deion Sanders has guided the Tigers to the conference championship game and energized a community. He says he’s just getting started.",,"JACKSON, Miss. — Grease-stained brown paper bags filled the counter at Stamps Super Burgers, a tiny burger joint near the campus of Jackson State, and the orders kept coming and coming.But it wasn’t a change in recipe bringing a spike in orders.Since the arrival of the university’s high-profile head football coach, the Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, in September 2020, local businesses like Stamps, which Sanders highlighted in an Instagram post, have seen a surge in exposure and business.Jackson State’s on-field turnaround since Sanders’s arrival has been just as rapid. The program, which plays at the Football Championship Subdivision level in the Southwestern Athletic Conference, was once a perennial powerhouse among historically Black colleges and universities. It had declined in the past decade but vaulted back into national prominence this past season, largely because of Sanders.After coaching the team through a condensed spring schedule following the conference’s cancellation of its fall 2020 season because of the coronavirus pandemic, Sanders guided the Tigers (10-1, 8-0 in the conference) to their first winning record and first conference championship game appearance since 2013.Yet almost more than the difference in wins and losses, the effect of Sanders’s arrival at Jackson State has been felt around the university and statewide. Local commerce has spiked as the school has gained widespread attention. The Hall of Fame pass rusher and television personality Michael Strahan, who played college football at Texas Southern, an H.B.C.U., had custom suits made for the football team ahead of the Tigers’ season opener. And Jackson State, as well as other historically Black colleges and universities, have received more national television coverage.Eight of Jackson State’s 11 regular-season games this fall were broadcast across ESPN’s networks and streaming service. That’s something that Sanders, who goes by the nickname “Prime Time,” promised after arriving in Jackson, not only for his school, but for H.B.C.U.s nationwide.“We’re going to give these kids exposure,” Sanders, whom the university declined to make available for an interview, said at his introductory news conference in September. “We’re going to put a light on these kids. We’re going to allow them to shine.”Four hours before Jackson State kicked off against Alcorn State in November, Tigers fans formed a line that wrapped around Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium.For a long time, the main attraction of a Jackson State football game was either the tailgate or the marching band, known as the “Sonic Boom of the South.” People would come for the band’s halftime show, then trickle out during the third quarter.That Saturday afternoon was different. An hour before the start of the game, nearly every seat in the stadium, which holds over 60,000, was filled in what the school said was the largest home crowd of the season. Few fans had left by the end of the game.“I call it the Prime effect,” said C. Daryl Neely, a Jackson State graduate and booster.He added: “There was at least a collegiate generation or two of people being in, say seventh grade and graduating from high school, and not knowing what it’s like to have 50,000 people in the stands for a J.S.U. game or not knowing what it’s like to want to go to a Jackson State game.”The Tigers won 11 regular-season conference titles from 1980-98, sharing the crown with Grambling State twice. Since the conference split into East and West divisions after the 1998 season and instituted a championship game, Jackson State has made it to conference title games five times before this fall, winning in 2007. The school was once a pipeline to the pros, sending nearly 90 players to the A.F.L. and N.F.L. from the early 1960s to the early 2000s, including the Hall of Fame running back Walter Payton.Jackson State has a renowned legacy (it has produced four Hall of Famers) but, like many H.B.C.U.s, it has few resources to compete in talent and facilities with other powerhouses.In the years before Sanders’s arrival, the Tigers had nine losing seasons from 2003-19. They haven’t produced an N.F.L. draft pick since 2008 and have changed head coaches four times since 2015. Ashley Robinson is the school’s third director of athletics since 2012 after turbulent tenures by his two predecessors. Bringing in Sanders, an unlikely but beneficial hire on a four-year, $1.2 million contract, is the biggest accomplishment of Robinson’s relatively short time at Jackson State.Though Sanders had no prior college football coaching experience, Neely said he was not surprised by the school’s quick turnaround, given Sanders’ status and professional football career.He produced the No. 1 recruiting class among Football Championship Subdivision schools in 2021, including 19 transfers and 11 of the highest-rated recruits in program history.Sanders has instituted a “nonnegotiable” standard at Jackson State, Neely said, emphasizing small details like making sure players are disciplined, punctual and professional and by measuring success beyond on-field results.“What is a win to us at Jackson State?” Sanders told reporters after the Tigers beat Alcorn State. He has made clear his goal of sending H.B.C.U. players to the N.F.L. (none were drafted in 2021). “If no one goes pro, I don’t feel like we won. If our graduation rate hasn’t increased, did we win? My thought process to winning embodies a whole multitude of things. It’s not just games.”Sanders is known as much for his flashiness, boisterous personality and ability to market himself as he is for his explosive 14-season N.F.L. career, during which he also played in Major League Baseball. He was a defensive back and punt returner, winning Super Bowls with the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys.In retirement, Sanders had worked as an analyst for N.F.L. Network and CBS Sports. In 2012, he co-founded Prime Prep Academy, a charter school in Texas that was supposed to become a powerhouse but instead, was engulfed in financial missteps and academic strife and collapsed after nearly three years.Sanders at the time accused the news media of racism and a vendetta but his current thinking was not known because he was not made available for an interview.Before going to Jackson State, Sanders was the offensive coordinator at Trinity Christian School in Cedar Hill, Texas, where he coached his sons, Shedeur and Shilo, who both play for the Tigers.Even before Sanders moved to Mississippi in 2020, the buzz around Jackson, which has a population of roughly 160,000 people, 82 percent of whom are Black or African American, according to 2019 census estimates, was far-reaching. Billboards with his face were placed around the city shortly after the school announced his hire, and the excitement has extended to the crowds of people who show up to the stadium each week.“This program has to be, and is historically connected to the city,” Neely said. He added: “And when you get 60,000 people in the stands, that’s when you know you’re back to it being the program of the city.”Sanders’s quick success in Jackson has provided a peek at how a high-profile face can provide both exposure and opportunity for programs at historically Black colleges and universities that don’t have the same resources as their Power 5 counterparts.Less than a year after Sanders went to Jackson State, Tennessee State, another H.B.C.U., announced the hiring of former Titans running back Eddie George, who had consulted Sanders before taking the head coaching job.Neely said while he expected other H.B.C.U.s to seek high-profile coaches who might take the job for reasons other than pay, it’s not the only path to success.“There are plenty of high-profile, highly motivated, capable coaches, who may not be N.F.L. players but have the same drive and determination and vision that a Coach Deion Sanders has,” he said.Sanders’s success at Jackson State has prompted rumors that he could potentially be a candidate for Power 5 coaching jobs, but he has insisted this season’s success in Jackson is not the end.“We’re not finished by all means,” Sanders said in a news conference. “We want to be dominant. We want to finish. Right now we’re in the middle of the sentence. We’re trying to get to the exclamation mark, slowly but surely.”"
25,M.L.B. Lockout: ‘We Understand It’s Bad for Our Business’,"As the league and its players’ union settle in for a fight that the union called “unnecessary and provocative,” both sides went public to state their cases.","Dec. 2, 2021","IRVING, Texas — On Thursday morning, many baseball fans woke up to find their favorite sport in a very different state.At 12:01 a.m. Eastern on Thursday, immediately after the collective bargaining agreement between the owners of Major League Baseball’s 30 clubs and the players expired and no new deal was reached, the league instituted a lockout. The move began the ninth work stoppage in M.L.B. history — and first in 26 years — bringing the sport to a virtual standstill.Immediately, all of the M.L.B.’s websites, including MLB.com and the various team sites, had been scrubbed of mentions of current players. Citing the lockout and labor law, M.L.B. removed players’ photos from their statistics pages and replaced them all with the same generic silhouette. And the dominant presence on the sites was an 800-word letter that M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred wrote to fans explaining the league’s decision to enact what he called a “defensive lockout.”Nine hours later, Manfred sat in front of TV cameras at Globe Life Field, the Arlington, Texas, home of the Rangers, to further explain why he thought it had come to this.“It’s not a good thing for the sport,” he said of a lockout, even one that comes during the off-season. “It’s not something that we undertake lightly. We understand it’s bad for our business. We took it out of a desire to drive the process forward to an agreement now.”Players, though, will not be pushed around, said Tony Clark, the executive director of their union. When he and Bruce Meyer, the union’s lead negotiator, met with reporters not long after Manfred spoke, Clark said M.L.B. had referenced a possible lockout “on more than one occasion” during negotiations should a new agreement not be struck by 11:59 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday.Much like Manfred said about his own side (“We came to Texas to make a deal”), Clark said his side had hoped to reach a new agreement this week while in the Dallas area, where the union held its annual executive board meetings at a hotel. (M.L.B. officials and a handful of key club owners came to Texas this week to negotiate directly with the union and players.) And much like Manfred said about the union, Clark said it seemed like M.L.B. wasn’t trying hard enough to strike a pact.“From the outset, it seems as if the league has been more interested in the appearance of bargaining than bargaining itself,” said Clark, who then stressed that M.L.B. wasn’t required to impose a lockout. He added, “And contrary to the statement that imposing a lockout would be helpful in bringing negotiations to a conclusion, players consider it unnecessary and provocative. This lockout won’t pressure or intimidate players into a deal that they don’t believe is fair.”Manfred said he had the support of all 30 clubs to enact the lockout, which freezes all contact with players and transactions, from free-agent signings to trades. He added, citing the National Labor Relations Act, “We didn’t feel that sense of pressure from the other side during the course of this week, and the only tool available to you under the Act is to apply economic leverage.”Manfred repeatedly referenced the 1994-95 strike — the last work stoppage in baseball to cost regular-season games (over 900 in all) — as a lesson for now. When the C.B.A. expired then, the 1994 season began without a new agreement. Players went on strike in August as M.L.B. sought to add a salary cap. The union successfully avoided the institution of a cap, but the 1994 World Series was canceled and the strike didn’t end until April 1995, with a legal battle playing out in public.“We made the mistake of playing without a collective bargaining agreement in 1994, and it cost our fans and our clubs dearly,” Manfred said. “We will not make that same mistake again.”This expired five-year C.B.A. was viewed as having further tilted the balance in the owners’ favor. Top players have been awarded record contracts in recent years — and weeks — but the average major-league salary had either remained flat (around $4 million) or dropped. Younger players, who are cheaper, have been relied upon more by teams. And the union has been bothered by the clubs that manipulate players’ ability to accrue service time and the clubs that receive tens of millions in revenue sharing from their counterparts yet purposefully don’t compete for playoff spots.Players have wanted a series of improvements: getting younger players compensated sooner, allowing players to reach salary arbitration and free agency sooner, raising luxury tax thresholds (from $210 million to $245 million), reducing revenue sharing by $100 million, creating ways that could curb service time manipulation, and forcing teams to be more competitive through a handful of measures, including changes to the amateur draft.Owners, though, believe baseball players have the best deal in professional sports. Among their proposals, some of which have been rejected by the union: an N.B.A.-style lottery format for the first three picks in the draft that could help prevent so-called tanking, a club payroll floor ($100 million) along with a lower luxury tax threshold ($180 million) — or more modest luxury tax threshold increases (starting with $214 million) without a floor but with steeper rates for going over, overhauling the salary arbitration system, smaller increases to league minimum salaries and making free agency based on age (29.5) instead of service time (six years).In his letter, Manfred characterized the union’s requests as “collectively the most extreme set of proposals in their history.”He added at his news conference on Thursday: “We already have teams in smaller markets that struggle to compete. Shortening the period of time that they control players makes it even harder for them to compete. It’s also bad for fans in those markets. The most negative reaction we have is when a player leaves via free agency. We don’t see that making it available earlier as a positive. Taking $100 million away from teams that are already struggling to put a competitive product on the field, I don’t see how that’s helpful.”The union fired back. Meyer said the proposal to allow players to reach salary arbitration eligibility at two years of service time, not three, wasn’t “radical” because it had been like that for about 15 years before. (In 1987, eligibility was pushed back from two years to three.) And he said combating service time manipulation also wasn’t extreme.“We believe that the radical proposals have come from the other side, not from us,” said Meyer, contending that M.L.B.’s proposals for arbitration and free agency would be worse for players. He said the union’s proposed changes were meant to improve the competition among teams, including measures to help small-market teams.“The league has consistently said on revenue sharing they will not change it, period,” Meyer added later. “So that’s just an example of what we’ve been saying that the league really hasn’t been prepared to negotiate. It’s a whole list of topics that they told us they will not negotiate.”Clark said the union made “proposals that moved significantly” toward M.L.B. on “a number of key economic issues.” (The union, for example, offered on Tuesday a version of expanded playoffs, which the owners have wanted, and allowing advertising patches on jerseys, which would net more revenue.) He said M.L.B. “refused repeatedly” to make counter offers in Dallas on any of the union’s core economic issues.Manfred bristled at the notion that the league hadn’t made enough proposals. He said, for example, that M.L.B. made an offer on Wednesday morning — the day of the C.B.A. expiration — that “if it had been accepted, I believe would have provided a pretty clear path to make an agreement.”Meyer said the union didn’t consider that a proposal because it came with binding stipulations that they drop a number of key demands before seeing the rest of M.L.B.’s offer.“We proposed the elimination of draft-choice compensation,” Manfred said of one of M.L.B.’s offers. “This industry had a strike over that issue in 1985. That is a major concession that has been the source of friction as to how the free agency system has operated. We have made concessions.”If it would lead to a fair agreement, Manfred said M.L.B. was prepared to make more concessions. Added Meyer, “We are and have always been ready to negotiate on every issue. We have not drawn any hard lines in the sand.”Both sides said no further meetings were planned for the moment but they had agreed to keep negotiating. There is time to reach an agreement without jeopardizing games, but the clock is ticking to do a lot of heavy lifting. Spring training is scheduled to start in mid February and opening day is slated for March 31.Asked for his drop-dead deadline to avoid costing regular-season games, Manfred said it was “not productive” to speculate at this point.“As we sit here on Dec. 2, I’m not going to give you a date or a deadline for games to be missed,” Clark added. “Our hope is to get a deal done such that sooner rather than later the positive nature of what is going on in our game is garnering more attention and headlines than what is happening right now.”"
26,"With No Deadline Deal, M.L.B.’s Lockout Begins","Players and owners continued to negotiate until the final day, but with the sides still far apart, baseball has its first work stoppage since the 1994-95 strike.","Dec. 2, 2021","IRVING, Texas — For the first time in nearly three decades, Major League Baseball is in a work stoppage.After the owners of M.L.B.’s 30 clubs and the players failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement before the expiration of the previous five-year pact at 11:59 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, the league enacted a lockout. It was the latest chapter in fraught labor relations between the sides in recent years.While a lockout was not a requirement, the move is the owners’ cudgel. It had been used by owners in the four major men’s North American professional sports leagues in similar instances. After a flurry of free-agency activity leading up to Wednesday, a lockout brings the sport to a standstill. Teams are not allowed to talk to players, make major league signings or swing trades.“We believe that an off-season lockout is the best mechanism to protect the 2022 season,” M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred wrote in a letter to fans posted at 12:01 a.m. Eastern on Thursday.“We hope that the lockout will jumpstart the negotiations and get us to an agreement that will allow the season to start on time. This defensive lockout was necessary because the Players Association’s vision for Major League Baseball would threaten the ability of most teams to be competitive. It’s simply not a viable option. From the beginning, the M.L.B.P.A. has been unwilling to move from their starting position, compromise, or collaborate on solutions.”The union vehemently disagreed. Its statement read, in part: “This shutdown is a dramatic measure, regardless of the timing. It is not required by law or for any other reason. It was the owners’ choice, plain and simple, specifically calculated to pressure players into relinquishing rights and benefits, and abandoning good faith bargaining proposals that will benefit not just players, but the game and industry as a whole.”This is the ninth work stoppage in M.L.B. history, and the fourth lockout. The last time owners locked out players was before the 1990 season. None of the previous three lockouts led to the cancellation of regular-season games. In 1990, the 32-day lockout eliminated most of spring training, but the full schedule of regular-season games was played, starting a week later than usual.The last time a work stoppage damaged the regular season, though, was the 1994-95 players’ strike. It prematurely ended the 1994 campaign, canceled that year’s World Series and bled into the next season, costing the league more than 900 games.Players successfully staved off the implementation of a salary cap with the strike, but the episode left lasting damage on the sport. Still, there was labor peace over the following decades. And baseball grew into an $11 billion a year industry, with superstar players continually breaking records for contract size.But the mistrust between team owners and players has increased over the years. Two years after the last C.B.A. was enacted, before the 2017 season, the players’ union hired a new lead negotiator, Bruce Meyer, a veteran labor litigator who had worked for or with the players’ unions of the N.B.A., N.H.L. and N.F.L. The expired baseball C.B.A. is viewed as having further tilted the balance in the owners’ favor, with changes such as harder caps on international spending and stricter penalties for higher payrolls.Since then, the union and players have become increasingly vocal about what they considered flaws in the system. The tension between the owners and players came to a head last year during bitter negotiations over staging the 2020 regular season after play had been suspended during spring training by the coronavirus pandemic. Some players became more active in union affairs and more resolute in their opposition to how owners were running their teams.“We have a pretty good war chest behind us of money that we can allocate to players,” said pitcher Max Scherzer, a top union representative, during his introductory news conference on Wednesday with the Mets. Scherzer attended the news conference, which was conducted virtually, from the Dallas area hotel where labor negotiations occurred.Over the past five years, Scherzer said, the union has been amassing money to weather this labor dispute. He continued: “The best-case scenario is not to tap it. Obviously, hopefully, we get a deal at some point in time, but just know as players, we’re steadfast in our belief of how we see the game.”Throughout this year, M.L.B. and the union have met virtually and in person, with each side offering proposals and tweaks. The union’s first proposal on core economic issues came in May, while the league’s was in August. They found little common ground — strongly disagreeing on proposed changes to revenue-sharing, service time accrual and free agency — even during face-to-face sessions on the day the C.B.A. expired.This week, M.L.B. officials and the seven club owners who comprise the league’s labor policy committee came to Texas to bargain directly with the players during the union’s annual off-season executive board meetings. M.L.B. made a new proposal on core economic issues last week, while the union made another on Tuesday — both of which the other side rejected.Although the groups remained significantly apart, the season is not yet in jeopardy and negotiations between the sides can continue during a lockout. Spring training is scheduled to start in mid-February and opening day is scheduled for March 31.“This hard but important step does not necessarily mean games will be canceled,” Manfred wrote. “In fact, we are taking this step now because it accelerates the urgency for an agreement with as much runway as possible to avoid doing damage to the 2022 season. Delaying this process further would only put spring training, opening day, and the rest of the season further at risk — and we cannot allow an expired agreement to again cause an in-season strike and a missed World Series, like we experienced in 1994. We all owe you, our fans, better than that.”Players have wanted a series of improvements, some of which have been rejected by M.L.B.: getting young players (who are cheaper and have been relied upon more) compensated sooner in their careers, allowing players to reach salary arbitration and free agency sooner, raising luxury tax thresholds (from $210 million now to $245 million), reducing revenue-sharing among teams and ways that could curb service time manipulation, and forcing teams to be more competitive through a handful of measures, including changes to the amateur draft.Owners, on the other hand, believe M.L.B. players have the best deal in professional sports. Manfred said that despite complaints that free agency was “broken,” $1.7 billion was committed to free-agent players in November and that clubs were on a pace to set an off-season spending record. He also said the union “never wavered” from “collectively the most extreme set of proposals in their history.”M.L.B. has said it also wants to improve the competitive balance among teams but has proposed different ways to accomplish that than the union. Among its proposals, some of which have been rejected by the union: an N.B.A.-style lottery format for the first three picks in the draft that could help prevent so-called tanking, a club payroll floor ($100 million) along with a lower luxury tax threshold ($180 million) — or more modest luxury tax threshold increases (starting with $214 million) without a floor but with steeper rates for going over, overhauling the salary arbitration system, smaller increases to league minimum salaries, making free agency based on age and expanding the playoffs (from 10 to 14 teams), which would net more revenue.In recent proposals, M.L.B. has shown a willingness to get rid of the qualifying offer system, which attaches draft picks to certain free-agent players, while the players offered a 12-team expanded postseason.On Wednesday afternoon at the players’ hotel, Andrew Miller, a top union representative who pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals this year, and Meyer walked off with Dick Monfort, the Colorado Rockies’ owner and the chair of the league’s labor committee; Dan Halem, M.L.B.’s lead negotiator; and Patrick Houlihan, M.L.B. deputy general counsel. Seven minutes later, the M.L.B. officials returned, gathered their belongings and left.The players were then told that no more meetings with M.L.B. were planned for the rest of the day. Around nine hours later, M.L.B. implemented the lockout.“We remain determined to return to the field under the terms of a negotiated collective bargaining agreement that is fair to all parties,” the union said, “and provides fans with the best version of the game we all love.”Added Manfred: “Today is a difficult day for baseball, but as I have said all year, there is a path to a fair agreement, and we will find it. I do not doubt the league and the players share a fundamental appreciation for this game and a commitment to its fans. I remain optimistic that both sides will seize the opportunity to work together to grow, protect, and strengthen the game we love.”"
27,‘The Pressure of This Is a Privilege’,"As Max Scherzer was introduced by the Mets as baseball’s highest-paid player, he praised a team owner who was willing to spend to make his team better.","Dec. 1, 2021","In 15 years as a professional baseball player, Max Scherzer has signed contracts worth more than $370 million. It is fitting compensation for “one of the greatest pitchers of this or any generation,” as Steven A. Cohen, the Mets’ owner, called him on Wednesday. Cohen will support that belief by paying Scherzer a record annual salary of $43.3 million through 2024.Scherzer, as you might expect, thinks very highly of his new boss, who blew past Major League Baseball’s luxury-tax threshold to sign him. The other owners, almost all of whom act as if baseball has a salary cap, are the ones who bother him.“That’s a specific thing that we’re negotiating on right now: how teams view that as a cap and they won’t really spend too much over that, despite the penalties on that actually being pretty negligible, comparatively,” said Scherzer, who is part of the players’ union’s executive subcommittee, over Zoom from Irving, Texas. “So to see Steve show the fortitude to be able to go past it, and show that he’s going to do whatever it takes to win, that’s music to my ears.”If it sounds off-key to hear talk of a labor war in an industry awash in cash — well, as they say, that’s baseball. The first work stoppage since 1995 began just after midnight on Thursday with a lockout triggered by the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement.To the Mets, it all seems like a nuisance. Cohen, with an estimated net worth of more than $14 billion, is eager to get going in his second year as the owner of his favorite team. He did not care, he said, if his spending sent a message to the rest of the league.“I told you last year I wanted to win,” Cohen said. “I talked about sustained winning and winning championships — and I meant it.”He added later: “I’m concerned about the New York Mets, and I’m concerned about the fan base. I feel like I made a commitment to them, and I want to deliver on that.”Scherzer, 37, is only the latest pitcher to stop in Queens on his way to Cooperstown. Tom Glavine had 242 victories and two Cy Young Awards when he signed as a free agent with the Mets in December 2002. Pedro Martinez had 182 wins and three Cy Young Awards when he did so two years later.Both pitchers were well into their 30s and would have some highlights with the Mets. But neither would ever appear on another Cy Young ballot or lift the Mets to the World Series. Scherzer, who has 190 wins and three Cy Youngs, understands he must do more.“The pressure of this is a privilege, it’s not a problem,” he said. “I really enjoy being where you’re expected to win, and that’s what we’re here to do. That’s my job and I love doing it.”The Mets lost starter Marcus Stroman on Wednesday — he tweeted that he had signed with the Chicago Cubs — but upgraded significantly with Scherzer, who, at least for the moment, is the only pitcher in major league history with more than 3,000 strikeouts and fewer than 700 walks. Scherzer will team up with Jacob deGrom for a top of the rotation that inspires awe, even among teammates.“I haven’t seen Max or Jacob pitch, actually, ever, in person,” said Mark Canha, the former Oakland outfielder, who signed a two-year, $26.5 million deal with the Mets this week. “I’m very excited to witness their greatness and see their routines, see how they go about their business in the clubhouse. I feel ready to get inspired by that.”DeGrom, 33, missed the second half of last season with an injured elbow. Scherzer was also unavailable at the end of the season, wearing down in the National League Championship Series for the Los Angeles Dodgers after a heavy workload in the early rounds.“I overcooked my arm for a situation,” Scherzer said, referring to his save to clinch a division series in San Francisco. “I went past my work capacity, what I was built up for. Unfortunately, that happened. I didn’t foresee that happening, but it did. But from a long-term standpoint, a structural standpoint, a health standpoint, I’m ready to go.”In the regular season Scherzer worked 179 ⅓ innings, a total that would have led the Mets. He was good enough in the first half to start the All-Star Game, and got even better after a trade from Washington to the Dodgers in late July, going 7-0 with a 1.98 earned run average. Overall, Scherzer was 15-4 with a career-low 2.46 E.R.A. and 0.864 WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched), which led the majors.For Scherzer, the Mets’ deal fit for his family and underscored his sense of brotherhood to fellow players. He and his wife have three young children and live in Jupiter, Fla., near the Mets’ spring training complex in Port St. Lucie. Scherzer also smashed the previous record for average annual salary — $36 million for Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole, also represented by Scott Boras — in keeping with his history of fighting for value.Scherzer was the last first-round pick from his 2006 draft class to sign, joining an independent league team before getting a major league deal from Arizona worth $4.3 million. He was dealt to Detroit, where he won his first Cy Young Award and turned down a $144 million contract extension. The decision paid off when the Nationals gave Scherzer $210 million as a free agent.“I’ve been a big beneficiary of many players before me going out and fighting for those deals and fighting for those extra years,” he said. “That gives me the position to continue that fight. I’m happy to do it and hopefully that helps out future players as well.”It is not a sacrifice, of course, to sign a three-year, $130 million contract to play for a highly motivated owner in an ideal location. The system has worked well for Scherzer, but the sport, he believes, is not as healthy as it should be. No other owner may spend like Cohen, but more should make a better effort to win.“We’re trying to make the game more competitive, through various means,” Scherzer said. “There’s so many different ways as players, as a whole, that we believe we can make the game better. And we’re absolutely committed to doing that.”"
28,"Don Demeter, a Dodger Star of the Future Who Wasn’t, Dies at 86","Groomed to replace Duke Snider, he broke his wrist in 1960 and never lived up to expectations. But he had a fine career with four other teams.","Dec. 1, 2021","When Don Demeter was installed in center field for the aging Los Angeles Dodgers of 1959, largely supplanting the future Hall of Famer Duke Snider, he was touted as a star of the future.Demeter, a 23-year-old rookie with a powerful right-handed swing from his 6-foot-4-inch frame, hit three home runs in an April game at the Los Angeles Coliseum, the last one giving the Dodgers an 11th-inning victory over the San Francisco Giants. He connected for 18 home runs and drove in 70 runs in helping to propel the Dodgers to a World Series championship, a six-game victory over the Chicago White Sox, in their second season since leaving Brooklyn.“The winds of change were definitely in the air,” Snider recalled in “The Duke of Flatbush” (1988), written with Bill Gilbert. “Don Demeter was being groomed to take my place.”But Demeter, who at 86 died of unknown causes on Monday at his home in Oklahoma City, never fulfilled expectations as a Dodger. He broke a wrist in a collision with Dodgers shortstop Maury Wills in a July 1960 game and was traded early in the 1961 season to the Phillies when he got off to a slow start at the plate. Willie Davis, the future All-Star center fielder, had shown promise as a hitter while seeing limited action with Los Angeles the previous season and seemed ready to step in as a regular. In addition, the Dodgers got the Phillies’ hard-throwing relief pitcher Turk Farrell in the deal.Demeter did go on to a fine career, his best seasons coming with Philadelphia in 1962 and ’63, when he hit a total of 51 home runs, had another three-homer game and drove in 190 runs.Over 11 seasons Demeter hit 163 home runs playing for five teams. He played in 266 consecutive games without an error as an outfielder with the Phillies and the Detroit Tigers, a major league record at the time. (He did commit errors when he played at third base and first base.)Demeter’s outfield streak ended on a bizarre note with the Tigers in a July 1965 road game against the Kansas City Athletics.“They had some dogs that were trained to run out with bases in their mouths between innings,” he told an Oklahoma newspaper, The Shawnee News-Star, long afterward. “A line drive was hit to me, and they thought I caught it, so the infield crew let the dogs loose on the field. I scooped the ball up and threw into second base to hold the runner, and the dog ran through our shortstop Dick McAuliffe’s legs. Dick looked down at the dog and missed the ball I threw him, advancing the runner, and they gave me the error.”Donald Lee Demeter was born on June 25, 1935, in Oklahoma City, one four children of Lewis Demeter, a painting contractor, and his wife, Ailene.Don played the outfield on a state-championship high school team. A devout Baptist, he was offered an athletic scholarship by Oklahoma Baptist University but turned it down to sign with the Brooklyn Dodgers’ organization in 1953 for an $800 bonus (the equivalent of about $8,300 today).Demeter advanced slowly through the Dodgers’ vast farm system, and was finally called up by Brooklyn in September 1956 after hitting 41 home runs for the Fort Worth Cats of the Texas League.Facing the St. Louis Cardinals at Ebbets Field as a pinch-hitter in his major league debut, Demeter struck out on three called strikes thrown by their outstanding left-hander Vinegar Bend Mizell.“I was so thrilled to have a Brooklyn uniform on,” he told The News-Star. “I didn’t want to embarrass myself by swinging and missing the ball. I stayed up most of that night thinking that if I ever get to hit again, I’m going to swing.”The next day, pinch-hitting once more, Demeter hit a home run off the Cards’ lefty Don Liddle. “I thought I was in heaven already,” he recalled.Demeter’s reputation as a minor league slugger was duly noted in the clubhouse.“When I came in at the end of the game,” he told the Oklahoma newspaper in 1999, “some of the reporters there had written on the chalkboard, ‘Demeter — 59 behind Ruth.’”But he wasn’t deemed ready to earn a lasting promotion to the Dodgers. Demeter was back in the minors in 1957 and split his 1958 season between the minor leagues and the Dodgers.Snider was still a productive hitter during the Dodgers’ 1959 championship season, but he was hampered by a knee injury and played part of the time in right field, giving Demeter a chance to roam the Coliseum’s cavernous center field.Following his time with the Dodgers, the Phillies and the Tigers, Demeter played for the Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians. He retired after the 1967 season with a .265 career batting average.Demeter, whose death was confirmed by a grandson, Cole Cleveland, is survived by his wife, Betty (Madole) Demeter; a son, Russ; a daughter, Jill Cleveland; his sisters Betty Ragan and Delores Mohr; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His son Todd, who played in the minor leagues, died of cancer in 1996. After leaving baseball, Demeter owned a pool installation business. In his later years he was a founder and longtime pastor of the Grace Community Baptist Church in Oklahoma City.In September 2014, the Dodgers’ longtime manager Tommy Lasorda, having arrived in Oklahoma City to mark the Dodgers’ becoming part owners of its RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League, was quoted by The Oklahoman as calling Demeter “a Dodger through and through.”“He’s a preacher now, someone who helps saves people’s souls,” Lasorda added. “What I try to do is save people from rooting for other teams.”"
29,‘I Got Them Off the Hook by Winning’,"Lee Elder forced golf forward by winning his way into the Masters tournament in 1975, the first Black player to do so, laying a path for Tiger Woods and others.",,"How do we measure athletic greatness? By the number of big wins and unforgettable championships?Or by something less obvious but perhaps more profound: an athlete’s resolve to go against the grain and upend the status quo in both sport and society, even at the risk of personal harm?If the latter measure is as true a test as any, we must make room in the pantheon of the all-time greats for Lee Elder. An indefatigable African American golfer, he died on Sunday at age 87, nearly a half-century after he stood against the stultifying stain of racism and became the first Black golfer to play at the Masters, paving the way for no less than Tiger Woods.“He was the first,” said Woods, not long after he stunned the sports world by winning the Masters in 1997, at age 21. “He was the one I looked up to. Because of what he did, I was able to play here, which was my dream.”What a journey, what a life. The hard, tumultuous arc of sports in the back half of the 20th century — indeed the arc of American history during that time — can be traced through Elder.He was a Black man born in the Jim Crow South who taught himself to play golf on segregated courses and polished his trade on the barnstorming golf tour akin to baseball’s Negro leagues.He dreamed of making it to the biggest stage, but professional golf took its own sweet time while sports such as baseball, basketball and football slowly integrated. The Professional Golfers Association kept its Caucasian-only clause until 1961.Elder never wavered. He broke through on the PGA Tour in 1968, as a 34-year-old. In those days, with the battle for civil rights well underway, the Masters began receiving pressure to add at least one Black player to its field. In 1973, a group of 18 congressional representatives even petitioned the tournament for just that. Elder was among the top 40 money earners on tour and had played in multiple U.S. Opens and P.G.A. Championships — so why not Augusta National?But after choosing not to invite outstanding Black golfers such as Charlie Sifford during the 1960s, the tournament settled on a stringent requirement for its participants: victory at a PGA Tour event.Elder earned that at the 1974 Monsanto Open — the same Florida event where, six years earlier, he had been forced to change clothes in a parking lot because Black people were not allowed to use the country club locker room.Elder possessed an understated but firm resolve. He wasn’t quick to raise a fuss about racism, but he wasn’t afraid to speak up about it, either. “The Masters has never wanted a Black player, and they kept changing the rules to make it harder for Blacks,” he said, adding: “I got them off the hook by winning.”Since its inception in 1934, the Masters has dripped in the antebellum codes of the South. Held at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, on a former indigo plantation, the only African Americans allowed on the course were groundskeepers and caddies. Nobody described the Masters more truthfully than the Los Angeles Times columnist Jim Murray. The tournament, he wrote in 1969, was “as white as the Ku Klux Klan.”In the months leading up to the 1975 Masters, Elder was the target of multiple death threats. “Sometimes it was sent to the course where I was playing, sometimes it came to my house,” he said. “Stuff like, ‘You better watch behind trees,’ ‘You won’t make it to Augusta.’ It was bad stuff, but I expected it.”But on April 10, 1975, there he stood, at the first tee, surrounded by a gallery full of close friends, including the football star Jim Brown. When Elder smashed his tee shot straight down the fairway, he did not just make history at the Masters, he pried open the cloistered and often racist world of golf to new possibilities.Looking back at the contours of his career beyond 1975, one sees a consistent solidity. He won three more PGA Tour titles and then eight on the Senior Tour and represented the United States in the Ryder Cup. It will always be a great unknown — the heights Elder could have reached if the opportunity had been equal and he had been able to play PGA Tour events in his prime.We can say this much for certain: Elder fixed himself in the sports history firmament at the Masters in 1975. He will always remain there, a North Star for others to follow.Woods came along just over two decades later, winning the 1997 Masters by 12 strokes and announcing himself as the heir not just to Elder but to Jack Nicklaus, who won at Augusta six times. As Woods marched past a gallery of awe-struck fans on his way to receive the champion’s green jacket for the first of five times, he saw Elder, and the two embraced. Past met present, paving the future.And yet the road to equality in golf remains elusive. The sport was overwhelmingly white in Elder’s era and overwhelmingly white when Woods burst on the scene. It remains overwhelmingly white.The game is “still slacking quite a bit” when it comes to diversity, Cameron Champ, 26, whose mother is white and father is Black, said while speaking about Elder this week. Champ is one of the few players of African American heritage on tour and one of the game’s most vocal about the need to diversify.It took until this year — prodded by tumultuous nationwide protests over racism and police brutality in 2020 — for the Masters to truly give Elder his due.In April, aside Nicklaus and Gary Player, Elder sat at Augusta National’s first tee as an honorary starter for this year’s tournament. Tubes snaked into his nose to deliver oxygen. He was too hobbled to take a shot.A gallery of the tournament’s players stood nearby, paying proper respect to a golfer whose greatness extended far beyond the fairway. The cold, crisp morning had a reverent, unforgettable feel, recalled Champ, whose paternal grandfather fell for golf in part because of Elder and then taught the game to his grandson.But it took 46 years for golf to honor Elder at the Masters. Think about that.Why didn’t it happen in 1985, the 10th anniversary of his smashing past Augusta National’s color line? Or in 1995, 20 years after the fact? Or at any other time?Why must change always take so long?"
30,The Clock Is Ticking as Baseball Veers Toward a Lockout,"With the collective bargaining agreement set to expire this week, owners and players are negotiating over the sport’s future. A work stoppage seems inevitable.","Nov. 30, 2021","IRVING, Texas — The future of the sport is unfolding in the conference rooms of a luxury hotel here.On Monday and Tuesday, Major League Baseball officials and a handful of team owners met with players and players’ union officials at the Four Seasons Resort and Club Dallas at Las Colinas. Monday’s meeting lasted a couple of hours, while Tuesday’s sessions were both in the morning and afternoon.The clock is ticking. At 11:59 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, baseball’s foundation — the five-year collective bargaining agreement between the owners of the 30 M.L.B. teams and the players — expires. The document governs everything from the length of the season to roster sizes to the domestic violence policy to the sport’s economic structure.The economic structure has been the biggest sticking point for years now and remains so as the sides negotiate. M.L.B. officials and the seven club owners who comprise the league’s labor policy committee came to Texas to bargain directly with the players during the union’s annual off-season executive board meetings. But if a deal cannot be struck by the C.B.A.’s expiration, a lockout that would freeze the entire sport is possibly looming.M.L.B. has not had a work stoppage since the strike that prematurely ended the 1994 season, canceled that year’s World Series and bled into the next season. Players then successfully staved off the implementation of a salary cap, but the episode left some lasting damage on the sport. There has been labor peace since and baseball grew into an $11 billion a year industry, with superstar players continually breaking records for contract size.Since the last C.B.A. was struck before the 2017 season, though, the union and players have become increasingly vocal about what they consider flaws in the system. That agreement is viewed as having further tilted the balance in the owners’ favor, with changes such as harder caps on international spending and stricter penalties for higher payrolls.Players want a series of improvements including getting younger players (who are cheaper and have been relied upon more) compensated sooner in their careers, allowing players to reach salary arbitration and free agency sooner, and forcing teams to be more competitive through a series of measures including changes to the amateur draft.Owners, on the other hand, believe M.L.B. players have the best deal in professional sports and point to this off-season’s free-agent spending as one bullet point in that argument. M.L.B. has also said it wants to improve the competitive balance among teams but has proposed different ways to accomplish that than the union. Among its proposals, some of which have been rejected: changes to the draft order that could help prevent so-called tanking, a club payroll floor along with a lower luxury tax threshold, overhauling the salary arbitration system, making free agency based on age and expanding the playoffs, which would net more revenue.During this year’s World Series, M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred and Tony Clark, the executive director of the M.L.B. Players Association, publicly expressed some optimism that a deal will be reached ahead of the deadline.But there are many negotiation hurdles and fraught labor relations to overcome by Wednesday. The mistrust between owners and players has ratcheted up over the years. It came to a head last year during the bitter negotiations over the resumption of the 2020 season, which had been suspended during spring training by the coronavirus pandemic. The sides bickered for months and issued sharp statements.This year has been different, as both groups vowed to learn from the lessons of last summer and have largely negotiated out of the public’s eye. Players, though, have been more resolute than in the past. The dispute last year united them and forced some of them to pay more attention to the economics of their sport.At the owners’ meetings in Chicago in mid November, Manfred argued an off-season work stoppage was more palatable than one that hurt the season.“I can’t believe there’s a single fan in the world who doesn’t understand that an off-season lockout that moves the process forward is different than a labor dispute that costs games,” he told reporters then. He added later, “We understand, I understand, that time is becoming an issue.”If no new agreement is reached by late Wednesday night, M.L.B. owners could use a hammer immediately: a lockout that freezes all transactions. If that were to happen, team executives would not be allowed to talk to players, make major-league signings or swing trades.Although lockouts have occurred in the four major men’s North American professional sports leagues in instances like this, they are not a requirement. Should M.L.B. and the union make progress in their negotiations in the waning hours, the owners could temporarily hold off on enacting a lockout.On Tuesday morning, M.L.B. officials and owners such as Hal Steinbrenner of the Yankees, Mark Attanasio of the Milwaukee Brewers and John Henry of the Boston Red Sox emerged after more than 30 minutes from a meeting in which they heard a proposal from the union. They retreated to their hotel to talk but returned to the players’ hotel in the afternoon.In a large conference room, union officials and a contingent of players (an estimated 60 were in town for the union meetings) huddled with M.L.B. officials and the owners for over 30 minutes.Each side then broke off into their own conference rooms. At one point, Andrew Miller, a top union representative who pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals this year, and Bruce Meyer, the union’s lead negotiator, walked off with Dick Monfort, the Colorado Rockies’ owner and the chair of the league’s labor committee, and Dan Halem, M.L.B.’s lead negotiator.After nearly an hour, the groups parted ways. M.L.B. officials and the owners got in their cars to leave, while the players returned to their rooms. They planned to gather again on Wednesday. What happens next is in their collective hands."
31,He Helped St. Louis Land the Rams. He Squeezed the N.F.L. When They Left.,How an N.F.L. insider turned into St. Louis’s best weapon against the league in the battle over the Rams’ relocation.,"Nov. 30, 2021","The ultimate fix-it man in his native St. Louis, Bob Blitz was once a key facilitator for the N.F.L.: He helped lure the Rams to St. Louis from Anaheim in 1995 and represented the operators of the stadium where the team played for 21 years. When the lease came up, he was asked to co-chair a task force to keep the Rams from leaving town.But while Blitz and others amassed the financial commitments to build a new riverfront stadium, Rams owner E. Stanley Kroenke broke St. Louis residents’ hearts by sniffing out a new location in California. When the league gave Kroenke the greenlight to move, Blitz fought it in the way most disheartened Rams fans could only wish: in court.For the past four years, the country’s most powerful league has found itself mired in a legal cage match with the city, the county of St. Louis and the operators of the Rams’ former stadium over the departure of the franchise, which left for Los Angeles in 2016. With a trial looming, the N.F.L. and Kroenke lost a foreboding number of motions that led the league to settle the case last week for $790 million, in a move that could create a precedent-setting legal road map for other spurned cities.At the center of the fight over whether the league bent its own relocation guidelines to streamline the Rams’ exit, and deceived St. Louis in the process, stood Blitz.Like most inside men, Blitz is an enigma, even in his hometown where high school affiliation and country club memberships are calling cards among the area’s elite. Outside of his day job, the extravagant Christmas party he throws each year at a fancy steakhouse and watching the occasional local wrestling tournament, Blitz is rarely seen on the social circuit in town.Blitz, other lawyers involved in the case, and former officials who worked to keep the Rams in St. Louis declined interview requests, citing the litigation and a gag order. Blitz also did not respond to interview requests once the case had been settled.The N.F.L. declined to comment for this story. Blitz, a longtime plaintiffs lawyer, typically represents workers, unions and consumers, not entire cities. But he’s earned a reputation for doggedness even though he does not crow about his victories in front of the television cameras.He has also been involved with sports since his youth. Blitz played football and baseball and wrestled at University City High School. His father, Morris Blitz, was a school superintendent who introduced wrestling to students and in 1977 was part of the inaugural class inducted into the Missouri Wrestling Hall of Fame.Morris Blitz taught that successful wrestling revolved around earning leverage, and that the little guy is just as important as the big guy.They are characteristics the N.F.L. has learned were transferred to Bob Blitz, first as a friend and now as a foe.The city of St. Louis, the county and the St. Louis Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority — which operates the team’s former stadium and spent more than $17 million on the failed effort to keep the Rams in the city — accused the league and owners in 2017 of violating their own relocation guidelines when they voted to return the franchise to California, despite St. Louis coming up with plans for a new, $1.1 billion stadium.“I’m going to be polite and just say that their proposal and the facts contained in there are inaccurate,” Blitz told Missouri Lawyers Media in 2016. “And that’s the polite word. If I were just a fan, I’d be irate.”The legal team representing the plaintiffs featured lawyers from Dowd Bennett, one of the city’s most prominent firms that included Jay Nixon, the former governor of Missouri, who asked Blitz and Dave Peacock, a former top executive at Anheuser-Busch, to lead the task force to keep the team in the state.“In spite of his presidential look based on the pictures that I’ve seen of him on the internet, he could walk into my office right now and I wouldn’t know who he is,” Eric Banks, a former St. Louis city counselor, said of Blitz.Those who have worked with him describe him as a workaholic who gains energy from drawn-out courtroom battles against larger foes.“Bulldog doesn’t really capture Bob,” said Catherine Hanaway, a former U.S. attorney and Missouri House Speaker, who has opposed Blitz in court. “He’s a bull. He is a physically strong, imposing, aggressive lawyer and the other adjective I’d use to describe him is connected.”Hanaway and others say he works behind the scenes to bridge big gaps. They point to his work on the task force in 2014 and 2015, when he persuaded an array of public officials in a conservative state to pass financing for a new stadium.“He plays a very insider’s game,” Hanaway said. “He has close relationships with governors, with mayors, but it’s a real trusted adviser kind of a relationship and if you have that with those kinds of decision makers, you also have to be somewhat discreet or they’re not going to trust you.”Blitz’s deep knowledge of the Rams’ tenure in St. Louis, and the team’s maneuvering that led to its departure, made him an unusual weapon for the city as the N.F.L. embarked on an uncharacteristic losing streak after batting down a similar lawsuit filed by the city of Oakland in federal court against the Raiders after that team relocated to Las Vegas.After the league lost requests to have the case thrown out or moved into private arbitration, which would have prevented dragging N.F.L. business into the public record, it sought to have the trial transferred out of St. Louis to a more neutral jurisdiction. That request was also denied.In July, St. Louis Circuit Judge Christopher McGraugh ruled that several owners had to disclose financial information about their teams because they could be personally liable for punitive damages, a decision that did not rest well with the oligarchs.Last month, McGraugh fined Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, New York Giants owner John Mara, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft all between $5,000 and $8,000 and threatened to hold them in contempt for failing to comply with his ruling. The ruling that the N.F.L. did win may have ultimately been a tactical blunder. The league successfully petitioned to have Blitz removed from the case as a lawyer, but the change meant that he could have been called as a witness at trial, with his wealth of insider’s knowledge on full display from the witness chair.Blitz had already made his impact on the case as a litigator.Acutely aware of the league’s inner workings and personally invested — and presumably irate over their decision-making — he deposed some of the league’s most influential kingmakers, including Kroenke.The two Missouri natives faced off, each born in 1947, and each having attended the University of Missouri. The one accused of turning his back on the city answered to the other, who was charged with extracting some revenge.During their exchange, Blitz asked Kroenke if he had spoken to other owners about relocating to Los Angeles as early as 2013, a key factor in determining whether the league had negotiated in good faith with the St. Louis bundlers who were putting together a stadium proposal.“Before October of 2013, did I ever talk to anyone, any owner about the opportunity or the option to move to L.A.?” Kroenke said. “I think I probably did.”Kroenke said he did not recall how many team owners he had spoken with about a potential move.In a separate deposition in October 2020, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell was pressed repeatedly on the question at the heart of the lawsuit: Did the N.F.L.’s team owners ignore their own relocation guidelines when they voted to allow the Rams to move? Goodell gave elusive responses on whether the owners had considered each of 12 predetermined factors or if they’d voted merely because a Los Angeles deal was available.“And I will say it again that I think the ownership was very responsible in considering all of the various factors and really understanding the key issues and ultimately made a decision which is in the best interest of the N.F.L.,” Goodell said, according to a partial transcript of the deposition.The realization that an answer like that was unlikely to satisfy a jury of Missouri residents, combined with the prospect of several N.F.L. owners being called to testify, made settling the case a more pragmatic option than opening a trial on Jan. 10, just weeks before the Super Bowl is scheduled to be played at SoFi Stadium, the splashy $5 billion venue in Inglewood, Calif., that Kroenke built after moving the team west.In deciding to settle for $790 million, the N.F.L. closed its responsibility to Blitz and a city that has lost not just the Rams, but also the Cardinals, who left for Arizona after the 1987 season. But the league provided precedent for other scorned cities.“The host cities may actually begin to gain leverage back,” said Daniel Wallach, a sports and gambling lawyer who has tracked the case.For the N.F.L., the agreement ensures that a public rendering won’t happen and keeps private the juicy details of league business contained in the many documents pertaining to the lawsuit. It also ensures that the backbiting between team owners stays in house.Before the league opted to settle, Kroenke and the other team owners appeared to be at each others’ throats as he, according to multiple news outlets, attempted to free himself of the indemnification agreement that held him liable for legal expenses and potential damages related to relocation litigation.Now, Kroenke may have to pay for most or all of the settlement."
32,"Ready to Shine in the U.S., a Star Waits in Japan","Seiya Suzuki can hit for average and power, and plays solid defense. The only thing slowing his arrival is the possibility of an M.L.B. lockout.","Nov. 30, 2021","Seiya Suzuki is the only player in Nippon Professional Baseball history to homer the first time he stepped to the plate in five consecutive games.If Suzuki, an outfielder for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, signs with a Major League Baseball team this off-season, he could make his mark in another unusual way: as the only player from Japan to be allowed more than 30 calendar days to consummate a deal under the posting system, a mechanism by which N.P.B. players are dangled to M.L.B. teams ahead of their contractual right to jump freely.Suzuki’s posting is the 34th since the system was created in 1998. It has resulted in 21 player transfers, including high-profile signings like Ichiro Suzuki with the Seattle Mariners in 2000 and Shohei Ohtani with the Los Angeles Angels in 2017.Team owners in M.L.B. have enjoyed such a long run of labor peace with players that when the sides last experienced a collective bargaining impasse, in 1994, the posting system with Japan did not yet exist. In 1995, Hideo Nomo, who signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, became the first player in 30 years to come over from Japan, and only by exploiting a loophole in the agreements between the leagues.After some messiness surrounding Hideki Irabu’s acquisition by the Yankees in 1997, the posting system was devised as a way to inject order into such transactions. But as the current collective bargaining agreement, which was signed in 2016, is set to expire on Wednesday at midnight, Eastern time, Seiya Suzuki’s path to the United States could include a pothole if he doesn’t sign by then.If the M.L.B. team owners lock the players out, as expected, the 30-day negotiating window for a posted player’s services will halt along with all other transactions. While some details will need to be finalized, the expectation is that Suzuki will be afforded the standard 30 negotiating days in total, with his clock pausing for a lockout and resuming upon a settlement. Since he was posted on Nov. 22, he would have 20 days remaining upon a resolution.That may not seem like a big concern, but a protracted labor disruption could affect his decision. Spring training in Japan starts Feb. 1, roughly three weeks earlier than the current M.L.B. schedule. Beyond players with health issues, latecomers are almost unheard-of in Japan. If Suzuki has any thoughts of returning to the Carp, he would probably want to do that with the rest of the group on Feb. 1.Since Suzuki is 27, his contract is not subject to international bonus pool money restrictions. He is free to negotiate the best deal he can, with the Carp receiving a release fee from the signing team based on the total value of Suzuki’s contract, a sliding scale that begins with 20 percent of the first $25 million guaranteed and increases thereafter.Suzuki’s agent, Joel Wolfe, spoke with the news media in Japan on Monday and told reporters that between eight and 15 M.L.B. teams had expressed serious interest in Suzuki and that some remote meetings have occurred. Wolfe said the Suzukis do not feel pressured to make a decision ahead of a possible lockout and that he expects Suzuki will want to conduct on-site visits before making a final decision.While Suzuki is a star outfielder at the professional level, he did not earn early fame the way some of the more prominent Japanese players — such as the former Yankees Hideki Matsui and Masahiro Tanaka — did by starring in the National High School Baseball Championship at Koshien. His teams never advanced to summer or spring editions of the showcase. Suzuki was, however, a member of the team that earned Japan its first Olympic gold medal in baseball at this summer’s Tokyo Games, a quest so important for the country that N.P.B. suspended its season for 26 days so the best professional players could represent the nation.Suzuki had a disappointing tournament, batting .167, but all three of his hits came in his six at-bats against the United States in two games, including the gold medal contest. He batted fourth and played right field every inning of the tournament and hit his lone home run off Anthony Carter, a former Chicago White Sox draft choice.Nick Martinez, who took the loss for the United States in the gold medal game despite yielding one run in six innings, surrendered two singles in three at-bats to Suzuki. A former Texas Rangers pitcher, Martinez, a right-hander, has become familiar with Suzuki after playing four seasons in Japan with the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters and the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks.“Our preparation for him was to be a little more cautious,” Martinez said. “Japan had an all-star team. All eight hitters have major league potential, so to bat fourth in that lineup is all you need to know about his ability.”Suzuki was drafted out of high school in the second round by the Carp in 2012, the same draft in which another high schooler, Ohtani, was taken in the first round by the Fighters. Suzuki pitched and played infield throughout high school, but other than three games at third base in 2014 and some occasional stints in left and center, he has primarily played right field for Hiroshima.Suzuki, a five-time all-star, has 182 home runs in 902 N.P.B. games, including six straight seasons of 25 home runs or more, but his strength is making contact. His career batting average is .315, and he won batting titles in 2019 and 2021. He has hit .300 or better every year since 2016 and has won four gold gloves.After the Carp announced they would honor Suzuki’s request to be posted, he held a news conference in which he said he was inspired by Hiroki Kuroda, the longtime Hiroshima pitcher and former Yankee, who rejoined the Carp rotation for the final two seasons of his career in 2015.Asked about when he decided he wanted to play in the United States, Suzuki said, “At birth.” Then he continued: “No, honestly, I would say when Kuroda San came back here. He would say to me, ‘Look at these players in the U.S. major leagues.’ While they were playing the same game of baseball, the level of their play was so much different. It had a tremendous impact on me. I didn’t grow up interested in the American game and I never really paid attention to it until he convinced me to. Once he did, it opened my eyes to the kind of talent over there and it inspired me to want to compete with them.”He is now poised to get that chance, although it may take longer than usual."
33,Max Scherzer Smashes Salary Record in Deal With Mets,"Showing off the team’s deep pockets, the Mets agreed to give Scherzer, a 37-year-old right-handed pitcher, a three-year contract that pays him $43.3 million a season.","Nov. 29, 2021","After the Mets’ billionaire owner, Steven A. Cohen, flexed some of his financial might over the weekend with three new additions, he made his splashiest move yet.On Monday, the Mets and Max Scherzer, a three-time winner of the Cy Young Award, agreed to a record-setting deal that would pair him with a two-time winner of the Cy Young, Jacob deGrom, and that may usher in a new era for a franchise that has been disappointing in recent seasons.Scherzer’s pact is worth $130 million over three years, according to two people familiar with the negotiations who were granted anonymity because the agreement was pending a physical examination. The average annual salary of $43.3 million will shatter the previous record set by Gerrit Cole, who signed a nine-year, $324 million contract with the Yankees before the 2020 season.At the time of his deal, Cole was 29. Scherzer, though, is 37.Despite his age, Scherzer has maintained not only his mid-90s velocity but also his performance. With the Washington Nationals and the Los Angeles Dodgers during the 2021 season, he went 15-4 with a 2.46 earned run average and 236 strikeouts over 179 ⅓ innings. In September, he became the 19th person to reach 3,000 career strikeouts.His 0.864 walks and hits per inning pitched was the lowest mark in the majors, and he finished third in the National League’s Cy Young voting, behind the winner, Corbin Burnes of the Milwaukee Brewers, and Zack Wheeler of the Philadelphia Phillies.Scherzer is one of the most accomplished active pitchers in the majors — and among the game’s highest earning players of all time. Before his final season with the Detroit Tigers in 2014, Scherzer turned down a six-year, $144 million contract extension. He bet on himself and a year later he signed a seven-year, $210 million deal with the Nationals. He proved worth it, winning his second and third Cy Young Awards and helping lead the team to its first World Series title, in 2019.After they fell out of contention this season, the Nationals traded Scherzer to Los Angeles based on his preference to be on the West Coast. But Scherzer wanted to go to a team that could win going forward and he saw an opportunity with the Mets, whose spring training facility in Port St. Lucie, Fla., is only a 40-minute drive from where and he and his family live in Jupiter. His deal with the Mets also calls for an opt-out after the second year of the contract and a full no-trade clause.Scherzer will join a franchise that was a frequent opponent of the Nationals in the N.L. East, has not reached the playoffs since 2016 and went 77-85 in 2021. Before Cohen bought the team a year ago, the Mets languished in spending and in the standings since reaching the 2015 World Series. Over the past year, the Mets have also endured a number of scandals, from sexual harassment investigations to allegations of poor workplace culture.Intent on turning the Mets around, Cohen, the richest owner in baseball with a reported net worth of $14.6 billion, used his wallet to attract talented players. Since hiring Billy Eppler as the new general manager, the Mets have committed a combined $124.5 million to outfielder Starling Marte, outfielder/first baseman Mark Canha and infielder Eduardo Escobar.Then on Monday, they lured Scherzer, pushing their estimated 2022 payroll to a franchise record $266 million, according to Cot’s Baseball Contracts — the highest in Major League Baseball at the moment and far past the existing $210 million luxury tax threshold.Scherzer’s agreement was the latest in a flurry of activity around the sport before the collective bargaining agreement between the owners of the 30 M.L.B. clubs and players expires at midnight Eastern time on Dec. 1. Both sides have publicly expressed some tepid optimism that a deal will be reached by then. But given the many negotiating hurdles and fraught labor relations between M.L.B. and the players’ union, a lockout might be coming.Baseball has not had a work stoppage since the strike that prematurely ended the 1994 season, canceled that year’s World Series and bled into the next season. But if no agreement is reached, M.L.B.’s owners could enact a lockout to freeze transactions. Two members of the union’s executive subcommittee — infielder Marcus Semien and Scherzer — have now agreed to pacts in the days before the C.B.A. expiration. (Semien reportedly agreed to a seven-year, $175 million contract with the Texas Rangers over the weekend.)Should Scherzer’s deal become official, any news conference for him and his new teammates may need to happen by Wednesday with a potential lockout looming."
34,Baseball’s Paradox: Money Is Flowing on the Brink of a Shutdown,"Players are agreeing to huge contracts, and even struggling teams are getting in on the action. With a lockout looming, recalibration may be preferable to reinvention.","Nov. 29, 2021","The Thanksgiving leftovers are still in the fridge, and Max Scherzer is already on his way to the Mets. That alone proves that the baseball off-season, which tends to unfold at a plodding pace, has come alive.But is this a blizzard of spending, or merely a flurry? Is free agency now a winter wonderland for players, or is it barely snowing at all? Either way, the forecast calls for a lockout when the collective bargaining agreement expires Wednesday at midnight, Eastern time.It would be the first work stoppage since August 1994, when the owners baited the players into a strike that canceled the World Series. At least this timing is better, with spring training more than two months away. But failure to reach a new C.B.A. would trigger a transaction freeze, which explains all the recent activity. Free agents want to find a home before settling in for the long, cold, lonely winter.It shouldn’t have to be this way. Maybe the owners and players will settle all their differences quickly, but nobody expects that. The game’s economics deserve a careful, thoughtful recalibration. But it’s hard to believe that the system is flawed enough to shut down the industry.Since the last negotiation, after the 2016 season, the owners have pulled off a neat trick of lowering players’ salaries as a whole. The average salary fell by more than 6 percent, to $4.17 million, from opening day in 2017 to opening day in 2021. Franchise values continue to rise, of course, because so many billionaires want in.Nobody — players or owners — is crying poor. The players have been saying for years that the labor agreement discourages teams from spending by offering incentives to lose, which offends their competitive instincts. They also emphasize that if teams spend less on veterans, then younger players should be paid better.Both are sensible points. Yet several losing teams have been turning to free agency this month to spend their way back to contention. And the Tampa Bay Rays just gave a $182 million contract to Wander Franco, who has played 70 games in the majors.“The Rays have given me the support that I need, the development, the people that they have here,” Franco said through an interpreter at a news conference at Tropicana Field on Monday. “I wish to stay here for my whole career.”It doesn’t always work out that way. The players who signed baseball’s first $100 million, $200 million and $300 million contracts — Kevin Brown, Alex Rodriguez and Giancarlo Stanton — were all traded to the Yankees with multiple years left on their deals. But Franco has set another new standard: most money guaranteed to a player with less than a year of major league service.The trade-off is that Franco gave up several years of free agency, when the open market could have determined his worth. But when a 20-year-old player sets himself up to earn $223 million before his 33rd birthday (the deal includes a $41 million option for a 12th year), it seems like a sound decision.Here are some other noteworthy, widely reported November contract agreements (some will not be official until the parties sign off on contractual language and medical details):Perhaps the timing of all these moves is no coincidence. A flood of early deals could create the impression that everything is fine. A lockout would then shut off the cash spigot, leaving unsigned players clamoring for a labor deal.The owners have proposed a payroll minimum for all teams — accompanied, naturally, by a lowering of the luxury tax threshold at the top of the scale. But the sport actually has more competitive balance than the budget hawks want to admit: 15 different franchises have won the World Series since 2001, and that’s not including the well-run, perennial contenders Tampa Bay and Milwaukee. The N.F.L., the N.B.A. and the N.H.L. have had fewer different champions in the same time.The players also overstate some of their problems. Yes, young stars are underpaid relative to the value they provide. But lower-payroll teams need them to have a chance to win, and higher-payroll teams need them to more easily afford the expensive players. And some teams benefit by showing restraint on the open market; not every free-agent contract works out.The most significant obstacle to the game’s future is not the salary structure, anyway, but the play on the field. The players and the owners need to find a way to make the product as entertaining as it can be. As hard-throwing pitchers and high-strikeout hitters continue to get big contracts, that may be the biggest challenge of all."
35,"Lee Elder, Who Broke a Golf Color Barrier, Dies at 87","In his prime he played in a league for Black players, but in 1975, at 40, he became the first African American to take part in the Masters tournament.","Published Nov. 29, 2021","Lee Elder, who became the first African American golfer to play in the Masters tournament, a signature moment in the breaking of racial barriers on the pro golf tour, died on Sunday in Escondido, Calif. He was 87.The PGA Tour announced the death but provided no other details.When Elder teed off at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia in April 1975, he was 40 years old. Years earlier, in his prime, he played in the United Golfers Association tour, the sport’s version of baseball’s Negro leagues. The PGA of America, the national association of pro golfers, accepted only “members of the Caucasian race,” as its rules had spelled out, until 1961.Elder was among the leading players on the UGA tour, which over the years also featured such outstanding golfers as Ted Rhodes, Charlie Sifford, who was the first Black player on the PGA Tour, and Pete Brown while offering comparatively meager purses.Elder first played regularly on the PGA Tour in 1968, and that August he took Jack Nicklaus to a playoff at the American Golf Classic in Akron, Ohio, losing in sudden death.“The game of golf lost a hero in Lee Elder,” Nicklaus said in a statement on Monday.The Masters, played annually at Augusta National, had no clause barring Black golfers, but unofficially it remained closed to them. With the rise of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, however, it came under pressure to integrate its ranks.The tournament eased a bit in 1971 by announcing that any player who subsequently won a PGA Tour event would automatically qualify for it. Elder came close, finishing second in the Texas Open and losing a playoff to Lee Trevino in the Greater Hartford tournament in 1972.But those performances did not persuade the Masters to bend its new rule and accord Elder a spot. Elder broke through after capturing the 1974 Monsanto Open at the Pensacola Country Club in Florida, where six years earlier he and other African American PGA Tour members playing there had been refused entrance to the clubhouse. They had to dress in a parking lot.That victory finally brought the 1975 Masters invitation. In the run-up to the tournament Elder received death threats. He rented two houses near the Augusta National course and moved between them as a security measure.When he teed off for his first shot, a huge crowd lined the fairway. “I remember thinking, ‘How am I going to tee off without killing somebody,’” he told The New York Times in 2000, wryly reflecting on the pressure he faced.His shot off the first tee was straight down the middle, but he ended up far back in the field in the first two rounds, shooting 74 and 78, and missed the cut to continue to play through the weekend by four strokes. He received a fine reception from the galleries, though.“The display from the employees of Augusta National was especially moving,” Elder told Golf Digest in 2019. “Most of the staff was Black, and on Friday, they left their duties to line the 18th fairway as I walked toward the green. I couldn’t hold back the tears. Of all the acknowledgments of what I had accomplished by getting there, this one meant the most.”Elder played in the Masters six times, his top finish a tie for 17th place in 1979. He won four PGA Tour events and finished second 10 times, playing regularly through 1989 and earning $1.02 million in purses. He also played for the U.S. team in the 1979 Ryder Cup. He joined the PGA Senior Tour, now the Champions Tour, in 1984 and won eight times, earning more than $1.6 million. He won four tournaments overseas.Elder and his first wife, Rose Harper, created a foundation in 1974 to provide college scholarships for members of families with limited incomes. He promoted summer youth golf development programs and raised funds for the United Negro College Fund.In 2019, he received the United States Golf Association’s highest honor, the Bob Jones Award, named for the co-founder of the Masters and presented for outstanding sportsmanship.Robert Lee Elder was born on July 14, 1934, in Dallas, one of 10 children of Charles and Almeta Elder. His father was a coal truck driver. Both his parents died when Lee was a boy.Elder caddied at an all-white club in the Dallas area, earning tips to help his family, then went to Los Angeles to live with an aunt. He worked as a caddy again and dropped out of high school to pursue a career in golf, at times touring the Southwest as a “hustler,” winning private bets against players who had no idea how good he was.At 18, after playing against the heavyweight champion Joe Louis, an avid golfer, Elder became a protégé of Rhodes, who was Louis’s golf instructor.Following two years in the stateside Army, Elder joined the United Golfers Association tour in 1961. In one stretch of 22 consecutive tournaments, he won 18.Gary Player, the South African native and one of golf’s greatest international golfers, invited Elder to play in his country’s Open and PGA championships in 1971, having received permission from the prime minister. Black people mingled with white in the crowd at what became the first integrated golf tournament in South Africa since the adoption of apartheid in 1948.Elder’s survivors include his second wife, Sharon, with whom he lived in Escondido. He returned to Augusta National in 1997 to watch Tiger Woods win the Masters by a record-setting 12 strokes, becoming the first African American golfer to win one of golf’s four major tournaments.“Lee Elder came down, that meant a lot to me,” Woods said afterward. “He was the first. He was the one I looked up to. Charlie Sifford, all of them. Because of them, I was able to play here. I was able to play on the PGA Tour. When I turned pro at 20, I was able to live my dream because of those guys.”On April 8 this year, Elder became the first Black player to take part in a decades-old Masters tradition, joining Nicklaus and Player as that year’s honorary starters, who strike the tournament’s ceremonial first shots. Though he brought his clubs with him, arthritis in his knees left him without enough stability to take a shot.But he received a standing ovation. The ceremony, he said, “was one of the most emotional experiences I have ever been involved in” and “something I will cherish for the rest of my life.”"
36,The Mets Bolster Their Offense With Three Free Agents,"With Starling Marte, Eduardo Escobar and Mark Canha, the run-starved Mets addressed their biggest need while adding some defensive versatility.",,"In Billy Eppler’s last general manager job, with the Los Angeles Angels, his roster had a few big stars with exorbitant contracts, but not much else. The Angels collapsed under that lopsided structure, and a lack of depth has also stymied his new team, the Mets.“Personally, that’s one of my bigger takeaways over the last 10 years in baseball, is that importance of depth,” Eppler said recently, when the Mets introduced him as their new general manager. “I also suffered similarly, at times, when that was tested and you didn’t have places to turn to. And it’s just, frankly, not easy to go execute a trade.”The Mets avoided the trade market on Friday in adding the kind of depth Eppler wants. The team agreed to contract terms with three free agents: center fielder Starling Marte, outfielder/first baseman Mark Canha and infielder Eduardo Escobar. The deals were confirmed by a baseball official who was granted anonymity because the players must pass physicals to make the agreements official.Marte, 33, reached a four-year, $78 million contract agreement after a season with Miami and Oakland that was probably the best of his career. He led the majors in stolen bases, with 47, while batting .310 with 12 home runs and a career-best .383 on-base percentage. Marte was an All-Star for Pittsburgh in 2016 but served an 80-game suspension the next year after testing positive for the steroid nandrolone.Canha, 32, has been a versatile role player for Oakland since 2015. He has a .377 on-base percentage across the last three seasons and led the majors last year in hit-by-pitches, with 27, while hitting 17 home runs. Canha made at least 20 starts at all three outfield spots last season and has also made 81 career starts at first base.Escobar, also 32, made his first All-Star team last season before Arizona traded him to Milwaukee. He had his best season in 2019 (a .269 average, 35 homers and 118 runs batted in) but has a relatively low career on-base percentage, at .309. A switch-hitter, Escobar has started at every infield position in an 11-year career spent mostly with Minnesota; he profiles as a Jonathan Villar type, with more power and less speed.The investment in Marte, of course, is the most significant in years and dollars. It protects the Mets against the possible departure of right fielder Michael Conforto, who is a free agent, and theoretically gives them a better defender in center than Brandon Nimmo, who could shift to a corner spot.The Mets, however, were better than the average team last season in defensive runs saved by center fielders, according to Sports Info Solutions, and few players as old as Marte tend to last long in center field. Among major leaguers who were 33 or older last season, only the Yankees’ Brett Gardner started more than 70 games in center field.The Mets will likely turn their attention back to pitching now, after missing out on the free agent Steven Matz (who has a four-year, $44 million agreement with St. Louis) and losing Noah Syndergaard and Aaron Loup to the Angels in free agency. Among the top free agent starters are Max Scherzer, Robbie Ray, Kevin Gausman and Marcus Stroman, who led the Mets in starts and innings last season."
37,Mets Owner Blasts Agent Over Matz’s Decision to Sign Elsewhere,"The club hoped Steven Matz would return after rejuvenating his career in Toronto. Much to Steven Cohen’s chagrin, Matz chose St. Louis instead.","Nov. 24, 2021","Steven Cohen held back from using Twitter for about six weeks, avoiding the platform almost entirely as the Mets underwent a puzzling and painstaking search for a new general manager. When he hired Billy Eppler last week, Cohen, the team owner, said his tweeting would most likely resume.“Now that it’s over, I’ll probably get back on and give it another shot and see how it goes,” he said. “We’ll see. I mean, I think people like it, so why not?”Cohen was not kidding. On Wednesday morning, he made news on his feed by criticizing the agent for Steven Matz, the left-handed pitcher who turned down a chance to return to the Mets and reached a four-year contract agreement with the St. Louis Cardinals.“I’m not happy this morning,” Cohen wrote after reports of Matz’s deal surfaced Tuesday night. “I’ve never seen such unprofessional behavior exhibited by a player’s agent. I guess words and promises don’t matter.”Reached by text message, Matz’s agent, Rob Martin, said they had handled everything ethically and professionally and that they wished the Mets all the best.Martin said Matz had an opportunity to “author a phenomenal next chapter of his career in St. Louis” and that is where the focus should be.Matz was 31-41 with a 4.35 earned run average in six seasons with the Mets, who traded him to the Toronto Blue Jays in January for relievers Yennsy Diaz and Sean Reid-Foley and a prospect. Matz went 14-7 with a 3.82 E.R.A. in 29 starts for Toronto and showed interest in returning to the Mets, his hometown team. He reportedly got $44 million from the Cardinals.For the Mets, Matz is another missed target as they try to assemble a pitching staff. They extended a qualifying offer (worth $18.4 million) to retain Noah Syndergaard, but he signed with the Los Angeles Angels for one year and $21 million. The Angels also signed Aaron Loup, who excelled in relief for the Mets last season, to a two-year, $17 million deal.Marcus Stroman is a free agent, too, after posting a 3.02 E.R.A. across a team-leading 33 starts. Stroman turns 31 in May, like Matz, but has a more consistent track record and is expected to command a more lucrative deal.Theoretically, that should not be a problem for Cohen, who emphasized his willingness to spend while introducing Eppler as general manager last week. But though several free agent pitchers have signed or agreed to terms on new deals — including Justin Verlander with the Houston Astros, Eduardo Rodriguez with the Detroit Tigers, Anthony DeSclafani with the San Francisco Giants and Kendall Graveman with the Chicago White Sox — the Mets, so far, have been shut out."
38,"Bill Virdon, Quiet Manager of Four M.L.B. Teams, Dies at 90","As a player, mainly for the Pirates, he was an outstanding center fielder and hit a catalytic ground ball in the 1960 World Series against the Yankees.","Nov. 23, 2021","Bill Virdon was one of the major leagues’ smoothest-fielding center fielders of the 1950s and early ’60s. He managed four teams, winning division championships with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Houston Astros and bringing a surprising Yankee team to the brink of one. But many remember him most for hitting a seemingly routine ground ball that was anything but: It sent the Pirates on their way to a dramatic Game 7 victory over the Yankees in the 1960 World Series.Often described as “bespectacled,” given the relative rarity of ballplayers with eyeglasses, Virdon, who died at 90 on Tuesday, was the National League’s rookie of the year with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1955 but spent almost his entire career with the Pirates, playing alongside the future Hall of Fame right fielder Roberto Clemente.The Pirates announced Virdon’s death, in Springfield, Mo.Bill Mazeroski’s walk-off home run gave the Pirates the 1960 World Series championship. But Virdon played an important role in that decisive game, at Forbes Field, as the beneficiary of a bad hop. The Pirates were trailing by three runs in the eighth inning with a runner on first and nobody out when Virdon, a left-handed batter, hit a ground ball to shortstop Tony Kubek off the lefty Bobby Shantz.“Shantz was tough on lefty hitters, and he was tough on me, so I didn’t like facing him,” Virdon told Victor Debs Jr. for the oral history “This Was Part of Baseball Then” (2002). “But he hung a curveball, and I hit it hard, but it was right at Kubek. I said to myself, ‘Uh-oh, perfect double-play ball.’”However, the baseball bounced up as Kubek was about to snare it, hitting him in the throat. It was scored a single, and Pittsburgh had runners on first and second.The Pirates scored five runs in that inning, including a climactic three-run homer by the catcher Hal Smith, taking a 9-7 lead. The Yankees tied the game in the ninth, but the Pirates won the World Series on Mazeroski’s homer in the bottom of the inning off Ralph Terry.In Game 4, at Yankee Stadium, Virdon had driven in two runs and made a leaping grab of a drive by the Yankees’ Bob Cerv, crashing into the bleacher wall in right center. The Pirates won, 3-2, tying the Series.Virdon won a Gold Glove award for his fielding in 1962.He remained with the Pirates through 1965, managed for the Mets in the minors, then returned to Pittsburgh as a player-coach in 1968, his last playing season. He became the Pirates’ manager in 1972, taking them to the National League East title, but was fired late the following season.In 1974, Virdon was managing the Yankees but not as anyone’s first choice. The Yankees originally hired Dick Williams, who had quit the Oakland A’s organization after taking the team to a second consecutive World Series championship in 1973. Williams had been angered by the A’s owner Charlie Finley’s meddling. On the Yankees he was to replace Ralph Houk, who had left to become the Detroit Tigers’ manager.But the American League voided the deal when Finley and George Steinbrenner, who was completing his first season as the Yankees’ principal owner, could not agree on player compensation to the A’s, who still had Williams under contract. Steinbrenner instead signed Virdon to a one-year deal.The Yankees had not won a pennant since 1964, but with players like Bobby Murcer, Thurman Munson and Graig Nettles, Virdon kept them in the ’74 division race until the next-to-last day of the season. He was named the American League manager of the year by The Sporting News.Virdon received a new two-year contract following the 1974 season, at a time when Steinbrenner was under a two-year suspension for pleading guilty to federal crimes involving illegal contributions to President Richard M. Nixon’s 1972 re-election campaign.The tempestuous Steinbrenner bristled at what he felt was Virdon’s lack of fire as the Yankees stumbled in midsummer 1975. In late July, though he was not supposed to be involved with running the team, Steinbrenner went to the apartment of the Yankee president, Gabe Paul, and hollered, “Get rid of Virdon!” according to “Steinbrenner: The Last Lion of Baseball” (2010), by Bill Madden. Virdon was fired, and Billy Martin succeeded him in the first of his five stints as Yankee manager.William Charles Virdon was born on June 9, 1931, in Hazel Park, Mich., to Charles and Bertha Virdon, and grew up in West Plains, Mo., after his parents returned to their native state. There, his father ran a country store and his mother was a homemaker. He was signed by the Yankees out of Drury College, now university, in Springfield in 1950. When he had trouble with his hitting in the minors, his manager, Harry Craft, suggested he wear glasses. His hitting improved, so he kept them on.Virdon was traded to the Cardinals’ organization in April 1954 in a deal bringing the future Hall of Fame outfielder Enos Slaughter to the Yankees. Virdon batted .281 in winning rookie of the year honors in 1955, but the Cards sent him to the Pirates in May 1956 when he slumped at the plate. He went on to hit .319 that season and had a career batting average of .267 for 12 major league seasons.After managing the Pirates and Yankees, Virdon took the 1980 Houston Astros to an N.L. West title, the first one in their history. He later managed the Montreal Expos.After his years as a manager, Virdon was a coach for the Astros and the Pirates.He is survived by his wife, Shirley; his daughters Debbie Virdon Lutes, Linda Virdon Holmes and Lisa Virdon Brown; seven grandchildren; and 13 great-grandchildren.In his memoir “Uppity” (2011), the former Yankee broadcaster Bill White credited Virdon for taking the Yankees to a second-place finish in 1974, but he characterized him as “a quiet, standoffish guy who wasn’t particularly popular with the players.”On opening day 1975, Steinbrenner ordered Virdon to have the Yankee players listen to a tape recording that Steinbrenner had made to inspire them. By the time that season ended, Virdon had long been fired and the volatile Billy Martin was presumably supplying the needed fire. That Yankee team finished in third place."
39,A New Hall of Fame Ballot Is a Chance to Remember,"A great deal of ink will be spilled on the candidacies of Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz. For a moment, stop to consider the 11 other new candidates instead.","Nov. 22, 2021","The Baseball Hall of Fame unveiled the new writers’ ballot on Monday, and complicated only begins to describe it. This is the final appearance for Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling, and the first for David Ortiz and Alex Rodriguez. Each has a long history of boldface headlines, for reasons on and off the field.Eleven others are making their debut on the ballot, and it’s a decorated group: three Most Valuable Player Award winners (Ryan Howard, Justin Morneau, Jimmy Rollins), two Cy Young Award winners (Tim Lincecum, Jake Peavy), two All-Star M.V.P.s (Carl Crawford, Prince Fielder), two closers with 300 saves (Joe Nathan, Jonathan Papelbon) and two others with multiple All-Star appearances and a World Series championship (A.J. Pierzynski, Mark Teixeira).With apologies to Ortiz and Rodriguez — there’s no lack of written words about either guy — here’s our annual salute to the other newcomers up for election to Cooperstown.Sometime in the spring of 1999, the Seattle Mariners worked out a kid from Houston who had a scholarship to play quarterback at Nebraska. He also played center field and the draft was coming up. “What’s his name?” I asked an onlooker, who told me it was Carl Crawford.Zipping around the Kingdome turf and lashing liners from the batting cage, he looked pretty good to me. It was easy to imagine Crawford joining or succeeding Ken Griffey Jr. in Seattle, but the Mariners didn’t see it that way. They drafted two other players in the first round, spending more than $3 million on their bonuses. Neither reached the majors.Crawford was the first pick of the second round, when the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, then a fairly aggressive second-year franchise, snagged him for $1.245 million. Crawford would wind up with more wins above replacement (39.1) than anyone in his draft except Albert Pujols. He led the American League in triples and stolen bases four times each, and hit the first World Series home run in Rays history.Years later, I asked Crawford about that workout. He said he hadn’t performed very well; he was tired from a long flight. He ended up hitting .342 in his career against Seattle, his best average against any A.L. team — and in 2018, two years after his last game, the Mariners traded for his distant cousin, J.P. Crawford. He is now their everyday shortstop.In 2016, when his career ended because of two spinal fusion surgeries, Fielder was only 32. At a news conference in Arlington, Texas, he wore a neck brace as he sat beside his two sons: “I’ve been in a big league clubhouse since I was their age,” he said.Fielder was born in 1984 (that is why he wore No. 84 for the Rangers), and his father, Cecil, reached the majors the next year. Prince was 14 in Cecil’s last season, spent mostly with the Angels in 1998. I covered that team and remember Prince taking batting practice, launching bombs over the right field scoreboard in Anaheim. He would retreat to the dugout and sit there alone for a while, gazing at the field. He knew he would play there for real someday. Everybody did.In 2007, Prince, just 23 at the time, became the youngest player to hit 50 home runs in the season when he did it for Milwaukee. He would finish with 319 homers, the same as Cecil. Sadly, they were estranged for many years. But by the time Prince joined the Rangers, in 2015, the fissure had apparently healed. “It’s pretty cool,” he told USA Today then. “Real cool.”In 2004, Howard played 29 games for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons. That same year, the pilot was shot for the American version of “The Office,” a sitcom about a paper company in Scranton, Pa. As a nod to the local baseball team, a character was named Ryan Howard.The player and the show continued on similar trajectories. The Philadelphia Phillies promoted Howard to the majors. NBC picked up “The Office” for its prime-time lineup. For a while, Howard was the game’s premier slugger, the major leagues’ leader in homers (262) and runs batted in (796) from 2006 through 2011. “The Office” became a powerhouse of its own in those years, one of the funniest shows on television and a future streaming sensation.But in 2011, Howard tore his Achilles' tendon while grounding out to end a playoff series, and Steve Carell left “The Office.” The player and the show were never the same, but they did come together for an episode in 2013, when Howard made a pitch to Jim and Darryl’s new sports marketing company for a film based on his nickname.“Half biopic, half superhero movie,” Howard says. “A mild-mannered professional baseball player, Ryan Howard, hits a home run into outer space. Ball comes back with stardust on it, which transfers him into: ‘The Big Piece.’”Next time you step over a puddle of slush, think of Tim Lincecum — or, more specifically, this description of him by Roger Angell for The New Yorker in 2010: “Wait for that mound-eating stride of his: he’s a January commuter arching over six feet of slush. No, no — look at the tilt, the twist and torque, the flying arms, the balance lost and regained, the skinny bod, the high-school hair: he’s an X Games skateboarder headed for the Olympics. Nobody has ever pitched like this before.”A pitcher’s stride typically measures about 80 or 85 percent of his height. Lincecum, who is 5 feet 11 inches, had a seven and a half foot stride. He would twist his back to the plate, thrust his glove to the sky and then whirl his body toward the hitter, his pitches exploding with startling power.In his four-year run as an All-Star, from 2008 through 2011 with the Giants, Lincecum led the majors in strikeouts (977) while winning two Cy Young Awards and the first of three championship rings. He was never elite after that, but starred in relief in the 2012 World Series and threw no-hitters in each of the next two seasons.That gave Lincecum multiple Cy Youngs, multiple World Series titles and multiple no-hitters. Only one other pitcher in baseball history can make that claim: Sandy Koufax.When Derek Jeter got as close as he ever would to a Most Valuable Player Award, in 2006, he was runner-up to Morneau, the first baseman for the Minnesota Twins. When Josh Hamilton staged the most breathtaking home-run derby round ever, at Yankee Stadium in 2008, he was also runner-up to Morneau.Two years later, Morneau was hitting .345 in early July when he slid into second base to break up a double play in Toronto. His helmet collided with the right knee of the Blue Jays’ John McDonald, and Morneau pulled himself from the game. It was his second concussion — he’d been hit in the head by a pitch in 2005 — but not his last; a diving play at first base ended his 2011 season in August.“If anything good comes of it, it’s the fact that if parents see us big guys, professional athletes, missing good chunks of time, they’re going to take it seriously and not rush their high school kids back out there to play a football game,” Morneau told me in 2012, two years before he won a batting title for Colorado. He added later: “If parents can realize that and get past the fact that it’s not a sore hamstring, it’s not a sore elbow or something you can grind out and play through, there’s something to be said for that.”Not every baseball stadium has a name as charmless as, say, Guaranteed Rate Field or LoanDepot Park. Consider the Long Island home of the Stony Brook Seawolves: Joe Nathan Field.Nathan was pitching for the Twins in 2011, on his way to 377 career saves, when his alma mater opened the ballpark with help from his $500,000 donation. The next year, the Seawolves marched to their first College World Series in Omaha.When Nathan played for Stony Brook, in the mid-1990s, the program was Division III and he was a shortstop. Drafted by the Giants in 1995, he batted .232 and was told to become a pitcher. Instead, Nathan returned to Stony Brook to earn his business management degree.“I went in with my buddy to see what stockbrokers do,” he told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 2004. “I did it for like a week. I couldn’t do that. They are on the phone for like eight, 10 hours a day. And that’s not me.”Suddenly, the mound seemed more appealing. Nathan asked the Giants if he could return in 1997, and two years later he was in the majors. He stayed for 16 seasons.The Red Sox brought in Dave Henderson to throw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3 of their 2009 division series with the Angels. Henderson, of course, had homered in Anaheim when the Red Sox were down to their last strike in the 1986 playoffs, sparking a famous comeback. “That was bad luck,” the Angels’ Torii Hunter said later, and was it ever.Papelbon had thrown 26 ⅔ scoreless innings in his postseason career when he stood on the mound at Fenway later that afternoon, needing one strike to extend the series. He never got it. In a ghastly sequence — single, walk, double, intentional walk, single — the Angels stormed back off Papelbon and won the series. He never pitched in the postseason again.But he’ll always have the ultimate closer’s highlight: striking out a batter to win the World Series. Papelbon did it in 2007 in Colorado, blowing a fastball past the Rockies’ Seth Smith. That must have been extra sweet for Papelbon, because he went to Mississippi State and Smith went to Ole Miss.He didn’t exactly preserve the final ball for posterity, though: that off-season, he said that his French bulldog, Boss, ate it. Maybe.“If you believe it, you believe it; if you don’t, you don’t,” Papelbon later told reporters, cryptically. “What can I say?”More than 60,000 fans jammed into Qualcomm Stadium for a noon game under the San Diego sunshine on June 22, 2002. It was the biggest crowd in the majors that season, and the Yankees were in town. Jake Peavy, who had just turned 21, was making his major league debut on national television. It did not start well.Alfonso Soriano led off with a double, and with one out, Jason Giambi doubled him home. Then Peavy held the Yankees hitless until the seventh inning. “It was the thrill of my life when I walked off the field and got a standing ovation,” he said.There would be many more thrills to come. Peavy lost that first game for the Padres, 1-0, but quickly established himself as a star; five years later he won the National League Cy Young Award, leading the league in wins (19), earned run average (2.54) and strikeouts (240) for the pitching triple crown.Peavy never got another Cy Young vote but endured for nine more seasons, always making a strong first impression. Traded at the deadline three times in six years, he went 3-0 for the White Sox in 2009, 4-1 for the Red Sox in 2013 and 6-4 for the Giants in 2014. He ended those last two seasons with a World Series parade — and even bought a Boston Duck Boat for $75,000.When he was 38 years old, with Atlanta in 2015, Pierzynski did something nobody else that age has ever done — he caught 100 games and batted .300.“Never had any arm problems at all,” he said the next spring training, before his last season in the majors. “Never had back problems, never had leg problems. I’m 39 years old now. I go to my kids’ school, and they’re like, ‘How do you squat?’ I don’t even think about it. It doesn’t hurt. It’s my job. It’s what I do.”Pierzynski did that job 1,936 times, logging more games behind the plate than Johnny Bench, Yogi Berra, Mike Piazza and Ted Simmons. He never won a Gold Glove, but he was a career .280 hitter with decent pop who helped the 2005 Chicago White Sox win a title. He was brash and outspoken, so some folks missed what he was all about.“People focus on a lot of things about Pierzynski,” Simmons said, before Pierzynski’s last season. “Nobody focuses on the fact that he’s a pretty smart guy. That’s what impresses me most about him, because out here, there’s no place to hide. If you’re faking it, it’s just a matter of time — and not very long — before you get smoked out as an impostor.”Not surprisingly, Pierzynski now pairs that deep knowledge of the game with refreshing candor as one of baseball’s better color analysts for Fox Sports.The Phillies brought Rollins to the majors for good in 2001, and as soon as he got there, he led the N.L. in stolen bases with 46. He couldn’t wait to do it, it seemed, which made sense: Rollins is a native of Oakland who idolized Rickey Henderson.“I used to steal bases with him in my living room,” Rollins said. “I’d slide into the couch and everything.”Rollins would finish with 470 stolen bases, a total Henderson reached when he was 25 years old. But the game has changed a lot since the prime of Henderson, who had a record 1,406 steals, and Rollins’s total ranks fifth in the 2000s, trailing only Juan Pierre, Jose Reyes, Ichiro Suzuki and Carl Crawford.“These slide steps, these defensive shifts, guys not wanting to ‘give away outs’ — they’re stopping the running game,” Rollins said before the 2016 season, his last in the majors. “They figure if you’re not safe 80 percent of the time, it’s not worth the gamble. And it didn’t used to be that way.”Rollins was much more than a speedster. He was an all-around offensive force who set the franchise record for hits — and as an oracle, he was Philadelphia’s Joe Namath. Before the 2007 season, Rollins proclaimed that the Phillies, who had missed the playoffs for 13 consecutive years, were the team to beat in the N.L. East. They went on to win the next five division titles and a championship in 2008.There are 39 switch-hitters in major league history who had 8,000 plate appearances. Only three have a better on-base plus slugging percentage than Teixeira’s .869 — Mickey Mantle, Chipper Jones and Roger Connor, who played in the 1800s. Of those three, only Jones likely saw much of the pitch that changed the game for switch-hitters.“The cutter,” Teixeira said in 2016, when I asked him to name the biggest change in pitching since his debut in 2003. “As a switch-hitter, the cutter has changed the game for me more than any other pitch, because when you have to cover both sides of the plate, it makes your job a lot harder.“When guys would throw four-seamers in, you kind of know if it’s a ball or a strike and you can decide if you want to swing at it. If it’s a two-seamer, it’s going to come back over the plate, as a switch-hitter. So I’m always seeing the ball kind of going away from me. Sliders are down and in, so hey, lay off the ball down.“But you can’t tell that a cutter’s going to be a cutter — and then it moves a foot in on your hands. I truly believe — because I’ve seen the best changeups, the best sliders, the best four-seamers, I’ve seen the best of all pitches — that a good cutter equalizes everything else.”Teixeira said something else in that conversation that has always stuck with me. When a tall pitcher throws a curveball, he said, it seems to be dropped from the top of a ladder. That makes it especially difficult to connect, compared to another kind of pitch.“Now, give me a 100-mile-an-hour fastball, straight, in the zone, I’ll hit it every time,” Teixeira added, matter-of-factly. “I may not get a hit, but I’m going to hit it.”I’m sure I just nodded politely as he said it. But inside I was thinking: big league hitters, man. They’re just a little different from the rest of us."
40,A New General Manager Is a ‘Relief’ for Mets Leadership,"A lengthy process landed Billy Eppler, formerly of the Angels and the Yankees. Steven Cohen says the deal received “universal praise” from his fellow owners.",,"There are lots of reasons to be encouraged by the hiring of Billy Eppler, who was finally introduced on Friday as the Mets’ new general manager. As a pro scouting director, he helped win a World Series for the Yankees. As a general manager, he signed Shohei Ohtani for the Los Angeles Angels. At 46, he is young enough to appreciate the value of data, but old enough to honor the instincts of scouts.“I just came back from the M.L.B. owner meetings, and I can tell you: just universal praise for the hiring,” said the Mets’ owner, Steven Cohen, who is rebooting the organization again after a trying first season, on and off the field.“I mean, people coming up to me from everywhere saying that we got a real pro, well-liked in the industry, well-respected. So I’m excited. Listen, I put a lot of time into this, and like I always say, I’ve got a day job. So it’s a relief to get somebody that I feel really good about.”Cohen, a hedge-fund billionaire, made two dud investments last year. He fired the general manager he hired last fall, Jared Porter, after revelations that Porter had sexually harassed a female reporter. The interim general manager, Zack Scott, was fired this month after his late-summer arrest on a charge of driving while intoxicated.A protracted job search, in which Cohen and the team’s president, Sandy Alderson, failed to persuade several high-profile candidates, ended with a four-year contract for Eppler, who has a reputation for integrity. What he does not have, however, is a winning record as a general manager.Even with stars like Mike Trout and Ohtani, the Angels had a losing record in each of Eppler’s five seasons (2016 through 2020). Asked about it on Friday, Eppler outlined the challenges he inherited: overpaid players on long-term contracts, sharing a division with the well-stocked Houston Astros, an outbreak of pitching injuries, a barren farm system.“The lack of depth made us dip into free agency to fill multiple holes on the roster,” Eppler explained, “and when you’re thin on that depth, any injuries you sustain really make you fall through the ice.”Injuries and lack of depth have been familiar problems for the Mets, too, and Cohen conceded on Friday that answers may not come from within.“Our budget today, without even signing anybody, is already about $185 million or so,” Cohen said. “If we’re going to find the right type of talent, it’s going to, probably, be either trades with other clubs or free agents. We don’t really have a lot in the farm system to supplement what we need.“So it’s going to require probably spending, and that’s what’s going to happen. And I’ve let Billy know that I’m willing, for the right deals and the right free agents, to go and get the players we need.“We want to be competitive, right? We want to win our division and be in the playoffs and get deep into the playoffs, right? So we’ve got to field a team that has the ability to do that.”Of course, Cohen was also willing to spend last off-season, and the Mets got little from their highest-paid newcomers. Shortstop Francisco Lindor, starter Carlos Carrasco and catcher James McCann all performed well below expectations, and Lindor is just now starting his 10-year, $341 million contract.The rotation is a pressing concern. Noah Syndergaard has already left for the Angels (one year, $21 million) in free agency. Marcus Stroman, the only Mets starter who was healthy and reliable all season, is a free agent. The ace Jacob deGrom missed the second half with arm injuries. Taijuan Walker and Tylor Megill faded in August and September.“I look at the roster and definitely want to address the pitching,” Eppler said, mentioning the departure of Syndergaard. “We also are going to entertain things in the outfield and entertain things in the infield.”So the Mets need pitching, infield, outfield — and a new manager, too. The manager Eppler hired with the Angels, Brad Ausmus, is available; he served one year before the team’s owner, Arte Moreno, replaced him with Joe Maddon. Eppler offered no hints about his possible choice, but said it would be a collaborative decision.“Billy will be reporting to me, but we will certainly consult with one another,” Alderson said, outlining the Mets’ chain of command. “But I expect Billy to be driving this operation. I will be available as a resource, and as time goes on, what I would expect is that Billy will have even more latitude than he has immediately.”The Mets initially sought both a president of baseball operations and a general manager, before limiting the search to one hire. Alderson, who turns 74 next week, said the Mets could still revisit that plan next winter, effectively giving Eppler a year to prove he can run the department.“Steve and I will take a look at that at the end of the season and Steve will make a decision about the direction he wants to go,” Alderson said. “But Billy has lots of opportunity here to establish himself and grow and have an impact on that decision a year from now.”Eppler worked for the Yankees under George Steinbrenner, so the threat of a Twitter missive from Cohen is unlikely to faze him. Yes, Cohen said, he would continue to tweet because fans seem to like it, but he emphasized the importance of delegating authority.“You’re going to interfere in every decision, it’s just not going to work,” Cohen said. “At least, that’s how I run my other businesses, and that’s done well. And I expect to run it the same way here.“And that’s sort of the plan. You’re not going to fix everything the first year. I call it a little bit of a treasure hunt: as you go through the organization, you find things that you need to fix. That’s sort of what I would have expected, coming into an organization that was under-resourced, and we’re in the process. We made progress last year.”That progress was not always clear on the field, as the Mets wheezed down the stretch to finish 77-85. Now Eppler must do what he could not in Anaheim: build a winning team — and quickly. Free agents know where to find him.“Last night, I was starting to get a lot of texts from agents,” Eppler said. “And I responded to a lot of them, saying, ‘You’ll hear from me today.’”"
41,M.L.B. Finalizes Plan to Provide Housing for Minor Leaguers,"An advocacy group called the deal a “historic victory,” but noted that there were issues that might need to be addressed.",,"For many years, one of the biggest concerns of minor league baseball players was where they would live. Often paid below minimum wage, they frequently jammed several beds into one apartment. Some would sign leases in one minor league city only to be stuck with those obligations when they got sent to another level of the minors.Over the past few years, minor league players and advocacy groups have been more public about their plight. On Thursday, Major League Baseball, which took over running Minor League Baseball this year, announced that the owners of its 30 big-league clubs had agreed to furnish the housing for an estimated 90 percent of minor league players beginning with the 2022 season.The exceptions will be the players on major league contracts or the minor leaguers scheduled to earn at least $100,000 over a full season.“This step forward recognizes that the unprecedented nature of the past two years has further exacerbated affordable housing challenges across the country that existed before the pandemic,” Morgan Sword, M.L.B.’s executive vice president of baseball operations, said in a statement. “The owners are confident that this investment will help ensure that minor league players have every opportunity to achieve their dreams of becoming major leaguers.”Harry Marino — the executive director of Advocates for Minor Leaguers, a nonprofit founded last year to help serve as a collective voice for minor league players, who are not represented by a union — called the move a “historic victory” for players who “forced the league’s hand by speaking up throughout the 2021 season.”“Let there be no mistake: This victory is the product of collective action by players,” Marino continued in his statement. “While the magnitude of the victory cannot be overstated, it is important to recognize that minor league players had no formal say regarding the details of the plan, some of which create cause for concern. We look forward to receiving a full round of feedback about the new policy and to advocating for changes where appropriate.”According to M.L.B.’s announcement, the major league clubs will be responsible for providing the housing for the applicable players playing or practicing at every level of the minors or assigned to spring training complexes. The accommodations will have to be within a “reasonable, commutable distance from the ballpark.”They must also be furnished, and the major league clubs will be responsible for basic utility bills, M.L.B. said. Bedrooms must contain a single bed per player and no more than two players per bedroom. When apartments, rental homes or host families aren’t available, clubs must provide hotel rooms that meet the rules. Players can opt out of the team-provided housing if they choose to.In February, M.L.B. completed a long-anticipated and criticized takeover of the farm system, eliminating 40 minor league affiliates to bring the total to 120, as part of a larger overhaul the league has said it was pursuing to improve player development, cut down on unforgiving travel and upgrade rundown facilities. Sword said owners increased minor league wages by 38 to 72 percent in 2021.Still, Marino said “most minor leaguers make less than $15,000 per year and will be performing services for their teams from now until April without pay.” Players who did not get large signing bonuses when drafted or signed internationally often have to work second jobs to make ends meet.“In short,” he said, “housing is just one aspect of M.L.B.’s fundamentally flawed minor league system.”"
42,"In N.W.S.L. Season to Forget, One Last Day to Cheer","After the Washington Spirit and Chicago Red Stars met for the championship, their league entered the most consequential off-season in its history.","Nov. 19, 2021","To call the Washington Spirit’s season turbulent would be an understatement.The soccer team’s coach was fired after being accused of verbally abusing his female players. A handful of employees, mostly women, quit amid reports of a toxic workplace culture. Two of the team’s owners feuded publicly, leading one to pledge to sell his stake — but only after players released a statement urging him to sell. Oh, and two games were forfeited because of a coronavirus outbreak among players.By comparison, playing a playoff semifinal last weekend on a waterlogged converted baseball field was just another day at work.“We’re good,” defender Emily Sonnett said after the Spirit defeated the star-studded OL Reign, 2-1, on Sunday. “Aside from star power and international talent, I don’t think the Spirit get enough credit.”The Spirit may get that credit after a satisfying conclusion to a nightmare National Women’s Soccer League season, with their defeat of the Chicago Red Stars, 2-1, in Saturday’s championship game in Louisville, Ky.Now, the Spirit and the rest of the N.W.S.L. will look toward a future that remains murky as it grapples with several serious problems.The league’s first eight seasons were dominated by questions about whether it could survive where previous attempts at women’s professional soccer had failed. The ninth tested whether the league could survive an abuse scandal.Four N.W.S.L. head coaches were fired or departed quietly in the past year after various accusations of abusive behavior. One of them, Paul Riley, was accused by a player of coercing her into a sexual relationship. Eight of the league’s 10 teams have changed coaches since the beginning of the season, and the furor over the mishandling of reports of abuse led to the ouster of the league’s commissioner and top lawyer, the postponement of a weekend of games and weeks of on-field protests and off-field soul-searching.As it crowned its champion this weekend, the N.W.S.L. was being led by an interim commissioner, and it remained the subject of a number of overlapping investigations into the conduct of the league office and a number of its teams. There is neither a timetable for when the investigations might conclude, nor even a hint of what they will find and the changes that may result.Still, a string of overtly positive developments has offered the N.W.S.L. and its players hope that better days are ahead.Two new teams, Angel City F.C. and the San Diego Wave F.C., will join next season, expanding the league to 12 teams and into soccer-crazed Southern California. Angel City, based in Los Angeles, is backed by high-wattage investors like Natalie Portman and Mia Hamm, while billionaire investor Ron Burkle owns San Diego, who hired the former United States coach Jill Ellis as its first president. Both teams have already hired accomplished coaches.Not to be outdone, the owners of the league’s team in Kansas City have announced plans for a new $70 million stadium on the city’s waterfront. When finished, it will be the country’s first soccer stadium built primarily for a women’s professional team. And soon the league and its players are expected to approve their first collective bargaining agreement, an important step in formalizing the playing and working conditions for players.For the next few days, though, the league is hoping the focus will be on the present.The path the Red Stars took to the championship game was not nearly as turbulent as the Spirit’s; they are one of the two teams to have the same coach all season. But that does not mean it was easy.“This year was absolutely insane off the field with everything that was happening,” defender Sarah Gorden told The Equalizer on Thursday. She said the last two years, including the pandemic and the killing of George Floyd and the national protests that followed, had been a testament to “how strong the women in this league are, how strong the Black women in this league are.”To get to the semifinal, the Red Stars knocked off the favored Portland Thorns on the road in front of nearly 16,000 fans. They did it while missing the national team stalwarts Julie Ertz and Alyssa Naeher, who have been battling injuries all season. They also didn’t have forward Mallory Pugh, who sat out the game because of the league’s coronavirus protocols. IThe final provided a respite from a season filled with one disappointing revelation after another. Andi Sullivan, a Washington midfielder, spoke on Friday about “soaking up” the chaos of the season, and her coach, Kris Ward, said the team dealt with the chaos in part by looking at the practice and playing field as sanctuaries away from everything else.But as the confetti is cleared from Louisville’s Lynn Family Stadium after the final on Saturday afternoon, players will step away from the field for months, and the N.W.S.L. will enter the most consequential off-season in its history.There will be an expansion draft to conduct, a team to sell, coaches to hire and allegations to investigate."
43,Everyone Agrees: Shohei Ohtani Is the A.L.’s M.V.P.,"The Angels’ two-way star inspires extreme devotion from his ardent supporters. Baseball writers concurred, unanimously giving him the A.L.’s Most Valuable Player Award.","Published Nov. 18, 2021","Shohei Ohtani was extraordinary this season. Ohtani, the Los Angeles Angels’ two-way star, smashed 46 home runs, drove in 100 runs and posted a .965 on-base plus slugging percentage, trailing only Toronto’s Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the American League. As if that wasn’t impressive enough, Ohtani was also his team’s best starting pitcher, amassing a 3.18 earned run average and 156 strikeouts in 130 ⅓ innings over 23 starts.On Thursday, Ohtani’s historic efforts were rewarded with the A.L. Most Valuable Player Award. He joined the former Seattle Mariners star outfielder Ichiro Suzuki, the 2001 A.L. M.V.P., as the only Japanese players in Major League Baseball history to earn the award.Ohtani received all 30 of the first-place votes for the award, which is presented annually by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. He beat out his fellow finalists, Guerrero, who received 29 second-place votes, and second baseman Marcus Semien, also of the Blue Jays, who received 24 third-place votes.Bryce Harper, a star outfielder for the Philadelphia Phillies, was named the N.L. M.V.P.Few people beyond Ohtani’s inner circle may be happier about his achievement than Tomoyuki and Kaoru Iwase. They have never formally met Ohtani, 27, but they have watched him play perhaps more than anyone outside of his family.This season alone, Kaoru attended 136 of the Angels’ 162 games to watch Ohtani play (not including the Home Run Derby in Denver in July). Her husband, Tomoyuki, said he attended roughly 10 fewer games. The superfans used to fly to Japan to see him play for his former team, the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters in Nippon Professional Baseball. Tomoyuki, 49, estimated they went to 15 different M.L.B. stadiums to see Ohtani play this season. Kaoru, 38, posts about the travels on her Instagram page.They own roughly 300 Ohtani memorabilia items, from his Fighters and Angels jerseys to his bobbleheads to balls he tossed into the crowd. (No autographs, though.) A few years ago, they had a wedding photo shoot at Angel Stadium while donning — naturally — Ohtani jerseys. They used to live a 30-minute drive away from the stadium in Anaheim but last year moved to an apartment a five-minute walk from the ballpark.“Even in the off-season, we take a walk to Angel Stadium,” Tomoyuki said in a video interview. He added laughing, “It’s our main home.”So when Ohtani was announced as the A.L. M.V.P., the moment meant more — to the sport, to Japanese baseball fans and others — than simply the capstone of a magnificent campaign on the field.Throughout his career, even back in Japan, Ohtani has continually faced skepticism over his ability to remain a two-way player. It is hard enough being an everyday hitter in M.L.B., the top league with the best players in the world, let alone also serving as a starting pitcher.But all along, even after having Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow, his right, in 2018 and another elbow injury in 2020 forced him to miss nearly two seasons of pitching, he insisted on doing both. In his first season in M.L.B., in 2018 after signing with the Angels, Ohtani won the A.L. Rookie of the Year Award. Freed from the playing-time restrictions imposed by his teams in the past, Ohtani was even better this year.“Why I love Shohei and why he’s the best and why I’m chasing him, the reason is that his mind is the best,” Kaoru said, growing emotional. “He never changed his goal. In Japan, in high school, everybody said a two-player is impossible.”She added later, “He was No. 1 in Japan but everybody said, ‘You can’t do that in M.L.B., a two player.’ But he never changed his mind. He believed he can be the No. 1 player.”In a television interview after being named the A.L. winner, Ohtani admitted he had dreamed about winning an M.V.P. award one day when he first came to the U.S. to pitch and hit.“But I was more appreciative of the fact that American fans and the whole U.S.A. baseball was more accepting and welcoming of the whole two-way idea compared to when I first started in Japan,” he said through an interpreter. “It made the transition a lot easier for me.”The Iwases, who met in Japan, have been following Ohtani’s career since he was a highly rated prospect in high school and in much-watched tournaments then. During his five seasons with the Fighters, they traveled from the United States to Japan to see him play — and also visit their families while they were there. “Shohei was the first priority,” Kaoru said.The Iwases have watched Ohtani grow up, get bigger and stronger, hit some speed bumps, and now dominate on the biggest stage.Tomoyuki, now a U.S. citizen, moved to this country in 1997, when another Japanese pitching phenom, Hideo Nomo, was starring for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Tomoyuki’s favorite player used to be Suzuki — with whom he shares the same home region, the Aichi Prefecture. (Suzuki, who was also the A.L. Rookie of the Year in 2001, may become the first Asian player elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.)“We are very proud of Shohei and Ichiro,” Tomoyuki said. “Ichiro, of course, he’s special. But Shohei, he changed the rules. What he does is just unbelievable.”The Iwases, of course, weren’t the only ones to notice. Even though the Angels went 77-85 this season and extended their playoff drought to seven years, Tomoyuki said he noticed more Japanese people in the stands, too. During trips to Texas to see Ohtani play the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers, for example, he said they met Japanese fans who had come from Florida for the same reason.“Growing up, I watched Ichiro,” Ohtani said. “He also won the M.V.P., he’s someone I looked up to and someone that got me wanting to play in the big leagues one day. I’m hoping I can be that type of figure to kids that are watching me right now. And hopefully one day, I can even play with one of those kids that are watching me.”Because of their jobs as wedding planners, the Iwases can watch their favorite player all the time. Tomoyuki is a wedding photographer and Kaoru is a hair and makeup artist.They have their own companies, could work remotely this season and travel all over the country for weddings, lining up a few work trips with Angels road games. They find cheap ballpark tickets, and use cash or airline miles to pay their way. They try to arrive early to watch batting practice.Asked if Ohtani recognized them after so many years, the Iwases chuckled and told a story. In 2018, they flew to Seattle for an Angels road trip and brought a happy birthday banner for Ohtani, who turned 24 on July 5, the final game of the three-game series.Tomoyuki said Ohtani noticed the sign in the stands and perhaps recognized them but “we are afraid he’s thinking about us as stalkers.”The Iwases laughed as they said this. To them, Ohtani is inspiring and so is his journey — much like theirs, coming to a foreign land for work. The new plaque on Thursday simply formalized what they already knew.“He proves that the level of Japanese baseball is kind of high,” Tomoyuki said. “I’m very happy about that. And also, he proves himself as the No. 1 player, which was one of his goals.” Kaoru added seconds later, “I’m so proud of him.”"
44,Phillie Phavorite: Bryce Harper Wins N.L. M.V.P. Award,"Snubbed at the All-Star Game, Harper exploded in the second half, earning his second career M.V.P. Award.","Nov. 18, 2021","Bryce Harper knew just how to endear himself to the locals when he joined the Philadelphia Phillies in 2019. He signed a contract without an opt-out clause, showing loyalty to a city that demands it. He adopted the Eagles as his favorite football team, dropping the hated Dallas Cowboys. He formed a bromance with the most beloved creature in town, the Phillie Phanatic, paying regular tribute to the mascot with headbands, cleats and even a green sport coat.“It’s a blast going to play baseball every single day in this great city,” Harper said on Thursday night, adding later, “Being around the fans that we have, all they want you to do is work hard and try to win and try to be a great player each and every night.”Indeed, the easiest way to the heart of any fan base is to be the best player in the league. The baseball writers certified it for Harper on Thursday, voting him the winner of the National League’s Most Valuable Player Award for the second time of his career, and his first as a Phillie.Harper, a right fielder, received 17 of 30 first-place votes, ahead of Juan Soto of the Washington Nationals, who had six, and Fernando Tatis of the San Diego Padres, who had two. Brandon Crawford of the San Francisco Giants had four first-place votes but finished fourth in total points.As well as Harper played, the Phillies finished 82-80 and missed the playoffs to extend their drought to 10 seasons. The American League M.V.P., Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels, also played for a team that missed the postseason. It is fairly common for one of the M.V.P.s to miss the playoffs, but this was the first non-strike year since 1987 in which both failed to do so.The Phillies, who finished six and a half games behind Atlanta in the N.L. East, would not have contended at all without Harper. He played every game in the second half, coming back from a beaning by the Cardinals’ Genesis Cabrera in St. Louis on April 28. Harper missed seven of the Phillies’ next eight games and struggled at times to regain his form.“Everybody goes through ups and downs in a season; my up-and-down was getting hit with a 97 mile-an-hour fastball right in the cheek, and then it hitting off and tapping into my wrist,” Harper said. “I think for me, once I got hit in the face, I was kind of: ‘Oh, I’m great, I’m fine, I’m pressing my face, I’m OK to get back,’ not knowing that maybe it was a little bit too soon. I had to take a break and understand that my wrist was still hurting, my face, and my mental state probably wasn’t the greatest.”Harper was passed over for a spot on the N.L. All-Star team, but he rested with family and then punished opponents after the break with a 1.188 O.P.S. — compared to .684 for all of the other Phillies. Overall, Harper led the majors in OPS (1.044) and doubles (42) while batting .309 with 35 homers and 13 stolen bases.He is the sixth Phillies player to win the M.V.P., after Chuck Klein, Jim Konstanty, Mike Schmidt, Ryan Howard and Jimmy Rollins. With another decade left on his 13-year, $330 million contract, Harper, who turned 29 last month, has time to join Schmidt as the only player to win more than one for the Phillies. Schmidt — who won in 1980, 1981 and 1986 — announced the award for Harper on MLB Network.This was the best of Harper’s three seasons in Philadelphia, but all have been strong. Since joining the Phillies, he is one of only three players — with Soto and Atlanta’s Freddie Freeman — to have both a .400 on-base percentage and a .500 slugging percentage while playing at least 300 games.Yet while Soto and Freeman have helped their teams win titles in that time frame, the Phillies have largely squandered Harper’s performances. Hampered by a thin farm system, shaky defense and a weak bullpen, the Phillies are 191-193 since signing him. But Harper is optimistic.“Being able to have the teammates I have, knowing that I’m going to be with Rhys Hoskins for a long time, knowing that I’m going to be with Zack Wheeler for a long time, J.T. Realmuto for a long time, these are guys I want to be with on a daily basis,” Harper said. “I think we thrive off each other.”This week brought news that another star is certain to stay in red pinstripes for a while. On Tuesday, the Phillies settled a lawsuit with the designer of the Phanatic, allowing the team to bring back the mascot in his original glory: furry, flabby, and a friend of the M.V.P."
45,Cy Young Awards Go to Pitchers Who Never Stopped Believing,Milwaukee’s Corbin Burnes and Toronto’s Robbie Ray had hit rock bottom before they worked their way up to stardom.,,"In 2019, Corbin Burnes had an 8.82 E.R.A. In 2020, Robbie Ray had a 6.62 E.R.A. and was traded in what amounted to a salary dump. On Wednesday, both pitchers proved that great stuff and a solid work ethic can win out eventually, as they were named the Cy Young Award winners for their leagues.The transformation of both pitchers was equal parts shocking, based on how low their careers had sunk, and understandable when you consider their track records for overpowering batters. Through hard work, they figured things out, and batters paid a heavy price.Burnes, 27, followed his breakout 2020 season by starting 2021 with a streak of 58 strikeouts without a walk, joining Brandon Woodruff and Freddy Peralta in a Milwaukee Brewers rotation that effectively had three aces. That dominance continued as Burnes led the majors in E.R.A. (2.43) and strikeouts per nine innings (12.6). He received 12 of 30 first-place votes, beating out his fellow finalists: Zack Wheeler of the Philadelphia Phillies, who also received 12 first-place votes, and Max Scherzer of the Nationals and Dodgers, who received six. Burnes triumphed over Wheeler by way of 14 second-place votes to Wheeler’s nine.Ray, 30, stepped up as a left-handed ace for the Toronto Blue Jays, leading the American League in E.R.A. (2.84) and innings pitched (193⅓). Fashioning himself into a power lefty in the mold of Randy Johnson, who had served as a mentor for Ray in Arizona, he led the majors in strikeouts (248). That led to his receiving 29 of 30 first-place votes, beating out his fellow finalists: Gerrit Cole of the Yankees, who received the remaining first-place vote and 29 second-place votes, and Lance Lynn of the Chicago White Sox, who received 11 third-place votes.The awards are presented annually by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America.For the two award winners, finding stardom meant examining what was working and what wasn’t.“The biggest thing that I’ve done this off-season is the mind-set,” Burnes said in May. “It could be 3-0, I really don’t care — for me it’s 0-0, it’s 0-1, it’s 0-2, I’m attacking. In pitcher’s counts, I’m going at hitters. There’s no, ‘Oh, I’m behind here 2-0, 3-0, this guy’s a good fastball hitter’ — no. As soon as you fall into that trap, you’re done.”The seeds of Ray’s transformation were planted in 2017 when he received some advice from Johnson about believing in his ability.“He sat down in my locker and it was basically like a big brother who gets you in a headlock, like: ‘You better figure this out, because you never know when your last pitch is going to be,’” Ray said in September. “And I took that to heart. I ended up rattling off a 26⅔-inning scoreless streak, went to a sub-three E.R.A. and kind of ran with it.”Burnes is a homegrown star for Milwaukee after being selected in the fourth round of the 2016 draft. He has struggled with durability issues, often knocking himself out of games with high pitch counts, but his disastrous 2019 season seems like an aberration. His worst E.R.A. in any other season was the 2.61 he had in 38 innings as a reliever in 2018. While he should receive a sizable raise in his first year of salary arbitration, he is under team control until 2025.He took the loss in this year’s All-Star Game, allowing two runs in two innings, but Burnes more than made up for it by teaming with reliever Josh Hader for a no-hitter in September and pitching six shutout innings in a division series start against Atlanta.For Ray, a change of scenery was crucial in addition to the advice he got from Johnson. He had shown an ability to pile up strikeouts, and he was an All-Star in 2017, but the Diamondbacks grew frustrated with his inability to keep the ball in the strike zone. He had a 7.84 E.R.A. in seven starts for Arizona in 2020 ahead of a trade in which he was sent, with cash, to Toronto for pitcher Travis Bergen. Bergen was brought back to the Blue Jays for cash a few months later, meaning the Blue Jays essentially got Ray for free.That good fortune could be expensive going forward, however, as Ray is a free agent and expected to command a massive increase from his $8 million salary in 2021.The other finalists had plenty to speak for them, even if they came up short in the voting.Scherzer, who, like Ray, is a free agent, was good for Washington but absolutely electric after a midseason trade to Los Angeles, with a 1.98 E.R.A. in 12 regular-season starts. (The Dodgers won every game he started.) Wheeler, who had struggled to stay healthy in his time with the Mets, led the majors with 213⅓ innings pitched and led the National League with 247 strikeouts.Lynn was an All-Star for the second time and had a career-best E.R.A. of 2.69. Cole, who inadvertently became the face of the sport’s ball-doctoring crisis, struggled down the stretch — a slide some have attributed to a hamstring injury rather than the sticky substance ban — but still finished with a 3.23 E.R.A. and led the A.L. in strikeout-to-walk ratio. This was Cole’s fourth consecutive season finishing in the top five in his league’s Cy Young voting, but he has yet to win the award."
46,M.L.B. Free-Agency Tracker: Robbie Ray Heads to Seattle,"Ray, who won the A.L. Cy Young Award, will anchor the Mariners rotation. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, will replace Ray with Kevin Gausman.",,"In has been a complicated off-season for Major League Baseball, with a solid free-agent class rushing to sign contracts ahead of a lockout, which officially began just after midnight on Thursday, Dec. 2. Plenty of huge deals were agreed to in advance of the deadline but all other transactions will be on hold until the owners and players can reach a new collective bargaining agreement.For now, these are the major free-agent signings and contract extensions.Terms: Five years, $115 millionAnnounced: Dec. 1What a difference a year makes. Ray took a one-year $8 million deal last off-season in a bet on himself that his improvement in Toronto was real, and that bet paid off when he won the A.L. Cy Young Award. Ray led the A.L. in starts, innings, E.R.A. and strikeouts and erased the memory of his struggles in Arizona that resulted in his trade to the Blue Jays in 2020.Ray has always had the ability to pile up strikeouts but it was his control that came together in Toronto. Should that keep up, Seattle may have secured the best long-term starter of this free-agent class and the Blue Jays may regret letting him get away. The Mariners were surprisingly good in 2021, winning 90 games and being in the race for a playoff spot right up until the end of the season. Adding a left-handed ace who has reminded some of Randy Johnson could make the team far more formidable.Terms: Three years, $130 millionAnnounced: Dec. 1With a résumé that screams Cooperstown, Scherzer will join the Mets after a season in which he recorded the 3,000th strikeout of his career and had an incredible run of success following a midseason trade, with the Los Angeles Dodgers winning every regular season game he started.A three-time Cy Young Award winner who is still throwing gas at 37, Scherzer smashed the record for the average annual value of a contract and he will pair with Jacob deGrom in a Mets rotation that could be comically dominant in the postseason should both pitchers be healthy. Scherzer missing time in this year’s playoffs with what he described as a dead arm is mildly concerning but a player with his track record is worth the risk for a team that desperately wants to build a new winning culture.Terms: Seven years, $175 millionAnnounced: Dec. 1When Oakland let Semien walk away following his disappointing 2020 season, the best deal he could find was with Toronto for one season and $18 million. One year, 86 extra-base hits and 7.3 wins above replacement later, he was handed a massive contract in Texas. Once Corey Seager’s deal becomes official, the Rangers will have a $500 million middle infield.Semien’s 2021 was absolutely incredible. His .873 on-base plus slugging percentage was the second best of his career and he powered the Blue Jays with 45 home runs and 39 doubles while stealing 15 bases and playing stellar defense at second base.The deal, however, is not without risk for Texas. Semien is 31 and his seven full seasons in the majors have consisted of two where he played at an M.V.P. level (2021 and 2019), two where he was very good (2018 and 2016) and three where he struggled (2020, 2017, 2015). At his best he could make a case for himself as being more valuable than Seager. If he were to revert to his 2020 form, this contract could become an albatross.Terms: Five years, $110 millionAnnounced: Dec. 1Toronto was unable to retain Robbie Ray, but they will replace him in the rotation with Gausman, who was also a breakout star in 2021. An All-Star for the 107-win San Francisco Giants, Gausman had a 2.81 E.R.A. in 192 innings and he struck out a career-high 227 batters.The improvement in Gausman was impressive, and he seems like a solid option going forward, but it is hard to not view this move as a downgrade from Ray. Both players had fairly mixed track records before 2021 but Ray’s breakout season was stronger, he’s nearly a year younger and he’s left-handed. Gausman, meanwhile, will return to the A.L. East where he previously spent six solid but unspectacular seasons with the Baltimore Orioles.Terms: Five years, $56 millionAnnounced: Nov. 30The Marlins acquired Alcantara as a minor leaguer in 2017 and now that he has developed into a reliable front-end starter the team has committed to him through 2026 with a large contract extension. That the team recognizes his value despite his pedestrian won-lost record is heartening, as is the fact that Miami has seemingly shifted gears into trying to win rather than rebuild.Alcantara, 26, has a 3.49 E.R.A. in 86 career games (78 starts) and he averaged more than four strikeouts for every walk he issued in 2021. If the team can start scoring some runs — Avisail Garcia should help in that regard — Alcantara’s career record of 20-34 should start to turn around.Terms: 11 years, $182 million (a club option and various incentives can bring the total to 12 years and $233 million)Announced: Nov. 27Continuing a trend of teams locking up talent incredibly early in their careers, Tampa Bay signed up to have Franco, 20, as the team’s shortstop for the next 11 seasons despite his only having played 70 games at the major league level.“The pace at which Wander has developed speaks to his potential,” Erik Neander, the Rays’ president of baseball operations, said in a statement. “We have seen him do special things on the field, particularly for a player that is only 20 years old. He’s an exceptionally driven, budding superstar who can contribute to our success for a long time.”It is not hard to figure out why the Rays would be so optimistic. Signed as an amateur free agent out of the Dominican Republic in 2017, Franco was sensational in two and a half minor league seasons — he was named the top prospect in baseball by Baseball America, MLB.com and Baseball Prospectus — and was an immediate success in the majors, hitting .288 with an .810 on-base plus slugging percentage in 70 games. He had a streak of 43 games in which he reached base safely and he finished the season with 3.5 wins above replacement, a pace that would have given him more than 8 if he had played a full 162 games.The long-term risk of such a long contract is fairly obvious, but like the San Diego Padres with Fernando Tatis Jr. and the Atlanta Braves with Ronald Acuña Jr., the chance to lock in a transcendent talent made a big gamble worthwhile. If anything, the Franco and Tatis deals have emphasized what a bargain Acuña was at “only” $100 million.Terms: Starling Marte: Four years, $78 million; Eduardo Escobar: Two years, $20 million; Mark Canha: Two years, $26.5 millionWith the fourth-lowest scoring offense in the majors in 2021, the Mets needed to shake things up, and they did so in bulk on Friday, coming to terms with outfielder Starling Marte, infielder Eduardo Escobar and outfielder/first baseman Mark Canha.Marte, 33, is coming off his best all-around season. He led the majors with 47 stolen bases and thanks to a quirk of his trade from Miami to Oakland he managed to be in the top-10 in both the National League (fifth) and the American League (tied for sixth). More important was his .841 on-base plus slugging percentage, which included a career-best on-base percentage of .383. There is little doubt that he can hit, and he is sure to be a fan favorite, but there should be at least some concern if he is a long term answer in center field. According to Sports Info Solutions, Marte has been worth 71 defensive runs saved in 593 games in left field but has been worth minus-12 in 553 games in center. That, combined with his age, makes it likely that he will be a left fielder by the end of his four-year deal.Escobar and Canha are less flashy but they add offensive depth and defensive versatility. Escobar, 32, can play first, second and third base, was a first-time All-Star in 2021 and is two years removed from a season in which he had 74 extra-base hits — which helps make up for his pedestrian on-base percentages. Canha, 32, has spent time at all three outfield positions as well as first base and has a .377 on-base percentage with some power over the last three seasons.Terms: Adam Frazier to the Mariners; pitcher Ray Kerr and outfielder Corey Rosier to the PadresAnnounced: Nov. 27Frazier, who turns 30 next month, is coming off a career-best season in which he was an All-Star for Pittsburgh ahead of a trade to San Diego. He hit .305 with a .368 on-base percentage in 155 games and played solid defense at second base with seven defensive runs saved. He should be an upgrade for the team at second base, with Abraham Toro moving into a utility role.Kerr, 27, had a 3.18 E.R.A. over two levels of the minors in 2021 and struck out 60 batters in 39 ⅔ innings. Rosier, 22, was a 12th round selection in the 2021 draft and hit .380 in 32 minor league games split between rookie and low Class A ball.Terms: Four years, $44 millionAnnounced: No team announcement yet, but the deal was discussed publicly by his agent and by the MetsWhen the Mets traded Matz to Toronto in January it hardly seemed noteworthy. He was coming off a season in which he had a 9.68 E.R.A. in nine appearances (six starts) and his career E.R.A. of 4.35 was worse than league average once you adjusted it for his home ballpark. The change of scenery helped, however, and Matz, 30, finally realized some of the potential that had been talked about for years. He had a 3.82 E.R.A. in 29 starts and transformed from a pitcher the Mets were willing to give away with fairly little return to one they were clamoring to add back as a free agent.A return seemed likely for the Long Island native, but he had a change of heart and signed with St. Louis instead, irking Steven Cohen, the owner of the Mets, who believed the team would be given the opportunity to match any offers. While the Mets are undoubtedly frustrated in their attempts to build a starting rotation — getting Noah Syndergaard healthy only to have him leave didn’t help — it would be worth at least a touch of skepticism that the Matz of 2021 is the real one. In the event that he’s something closer to a league-average starter, the Cardinals would probably still be happy, as he could slot into their rotation behind Adam Wainwright, the team’s ageless ace, and Jack Flaherty and soak up some innings as a decent No. 3 starter.Terms: Three years, $36 millionAnnounced: Nov. 22After a 107-win season, San Francisco entered this off-season with only one starting pitcher (Logan Webb) under contract for 2022. Now they have two, with DeSclafani agreeing to return after a career season that saw his stock rise considerably.Underwhelming in his time with Cincinnati, DeSclafani, 31, had a 3.17 E.R.A. in 167 ⅔ innings for the Giants and kept runners off base to the tune of a 1.091 WHIP. He threw two shutouts and had 4.1 WAR, which is more than he had in the previous three seasons combined. The possibility certainly exists that 2021 was an aberration, but $12 million a year with a three-season commitment is not big money in this market and he would still be valuable even if he showed some regression in 2022.Terms: Two years, $17 millionAnnounced: Nov. 22Loup, who turns 34 in December, had some control problems in his time with Toronto but has ironed those out significantly. Building off a strong 2020 for Tampa Bay, he had a 0.95 E.R.A. in 56⅔ innings for the Mets, and his splits showed there is no need to limit him to being a lefty specialist as he held right-handed batters to a .211 batting average and .257 slugging percentage. The only home run he allowed in 2021 came against a left-handed batter, and considering that left-handed batter was Juan Soto of the Washington Nationals it is hard to hold that against Loup.The statistic fielding independent pitching suggests Loup has benefited some from good fielding over the last two seasons, with a FIP of 2.87 compared to a 1.43 E.R.A. But even if he declines some — there is inherent volatility with relievers — he would still be an improvement for an Angels team that did not have a reliable left-hander in its bullpen last season.Announced: Nov. 18Terms: Seven years and $131 million. He was eligible for salary arbitration and would not have reached free agency until 2023.Acquired at the trading deadline from Minnesota, Berríos apparently delivered on expectations as Toronto locked him in for the next seven years. A two-time All-Star, Berríos is a 27-year-old right-hander who has been a reliable and durable starter since 2017. In 12 starts for the Blue Jays, he had a 3.58 E.R.A. and he struck out 78 batters in 70 and a third innings, which makes his mediocre record of 5-4 a bit misleading.While few would quibble that Berríos is a good starter, the massive financial commitment will look a bit unusual if the team does not find a way to retain Robbie Ray, a free-agent left-hander who does not have Berríos’s track record but just won the A.L. Cy Young Award.Terms: One Year, $25 million (with a $25 million player option for 2023)Announced: Nov. 17, by his brotherIt has been a quiet few years for Justin Verlander, a right-handed ace, as he has dealt with surgical procedures on his groin and pitching elbow that have limited him to only one appearance since 2019. But in his last full season he threw the third no-hitter of his career and won the American League’s Cy Young Award. And with a résumé that screams “Cooperstown,” there was plenty of reason for teams to be clamoring for his services.What Houston can expect of Verlander, who turns 39 in February, is a little unclear after such a long layoff. But with multiple teams watching his workouts and a buzz developing that he had his old stuff, it was not surprising for him to get paid like an ace — and he got a pretty large vote of confidence in a player option that effectively guarantees him $50 million over two years.It is unlikely that Verlander has enough time left in his career to get the 74 victories he needs to reach 300, but helping Houston through another deep playoff run would add a feather to his cap in a career that already includes a Rookie of the Year Award, a Most Valuable Player Award, a pitching triple crown, two Cy Young Awards and seven other top-10 finishes in Cy Young voting. He also won a World Series ring in the Astros’ tainted 2017 season after going to Houston in a trade from Detroit.Terms: One year, $18.4 millionAnnounced: Nov. 17Fourteen players were offered the $18.4 million qualifying offer by their teams — which attaches draft-pick compensation if the player signs with another team — and only Belt accepted it. A leader on and off the field, Belt, 33, could still be negotiating a long-term deal, but he will assuredly be with the Giants in 2022, which very likely comes as a relief for the team’s fans, many of whom are probably wondering what the playoffs would have looked like if Belt had not been sidelined by a fractured thumb.Belt has had some injury issues over the years, but there is no denying he can hit. Over the past two seasons, his on-base plus slugging percentage is .988, which is fourth in the majors among batters with at least 500 plate appearances. The only players ahead of him make for impressive company: Juan Soto of the Nationals (1.042), Bryce Harper of the Phillies (1.021) and Ronald Acuña Jr. of the Braves (.989). That Belt has put up numbers like that in a park that favors pitchers is doubly impressive.San Francisco has plenty of players who had what might be considered career seasons last year, meaning the 107-win team could be in for some regression to the mean. But Belt is a safe bet to produce — provided he can keep himself on the field.Terms: Five years, $77 millionAnnounced: Nov. 16Detroit is banking on Rodriguez, 28, as a front-end starter, which he was at times for the Boston Red Sox. In 2019, he was Boston’s best starter by a fairly wide margin and finished sixth in the American League Cy Young Award voting (he had more wins above replacement than three of the pitchers who finished ahead of him). He missed the entire 2020 season after he developed myocarditis after having tested positive for the coronavirus, but he recovered to be Boston’s No. 2 starter in 2021. While his record and E.R.A. declined from 2019, he showed improvement in strikeouts per nine innings and walks per nine innings.In Detroit, Rodriguez should slot in as a reliable left-handed complement to the promising Casey Mize at the top of the Tigers’ rotation, and he should benefit a great deal from the shift from hitter-friendly Fenway Park to pitcher-friendly Comerica Park. To lure him, however, was pricey: Rodriguez is not only guaranteed $77 million, but the Tigers will forfeit their third-round draft pick to Boston as compensation since the Red Sox extended a qualifying offer to Rodriguez.Terms: One year, $21 millionAnnounced: Nov. 16Syndergaard, 29, will give the Angels the pitcher with the highest upside in this year’s free-agent class, but one who also comes with a great deal of risk. While the commitment is for only one year, Los Angeles, which is desperately in need of starting pitching, paid a steep price, guaranteeing the hard-throwing Syndergaard $21 million and sacrificing a compensatory draft pick to the Mets, who had extended a qualifying offer that would have paid Syndergaard $18.4 million.At his best, Syndergaard could be the ace the Angels have lacked. He has a 3.32 E.R.A. over six seasons and has averaged 9.7 strikeouts per nine innings. As a rookie in 2015, he was pitching in the World Series. In 2016, he was an All-Star. But things have been far rockier since. Syndergaard made only seven starts in 2017 because of a torn right latissimus muscle. And after uneven efforts in 2018 and 2019, he missed all of 2020 after having Tommy John surgery. Once he did return, he made only two token appearances in the final week of the 2021 season because of inflammation in his pitching elbow.Terms: One year, $8.5 millionAnnounced: Nov. 10After a fairly disastrous 2021 season, Heaney, who split the year between the Angels and the Yankees, will head back to Southern California in hopes of proving that his 5.83 E.R.A. (7.32 in 12 appearances for the Yankees) was misleading.“I know that I’m much better than my numbers say I was last year,” Heaney said in a video conference.The Dodgers have some reason to believe Heaney when he says that. A 30-year-old left-hander, he struck out 150 batters in 129⅔ innings in 2021 and had a solid strikeout-to-walk ratio of 3.66. Many of his underlying indicators show a pitcher who could be league-average or better, which would make Heaney a bargain at $8.5 million. He said in his introductory news conference that he had already gone over some potential tweaks with Manager Dave Roberts and Mark Prior, the Dodgers’ pitching coach, in hopes of unlocking his potential."
47,"An Indigenous Women’s Softball Team Beats Opponents, and Machismo",,,"HONDZONOT, Mexico — Playing barefoot and wearing traditional Mayan dresses known as huipiles, the Little Devils softball team smashes hits, snags line drives and dashes around the bases in the sweltering heat of a Yucatán Peninsula jungle town.The team recently delivered a 22-2 thumping to its opponents, the Felines, for another triumph in a season that has made the Little Devils a national sensation, for not only their style of play but also who they are: a group of Indigenous women from a traditional community that once discouraged women from pursuing sports, which were seen as the province of men.And the Little Devils now have company, the Yaxunah Amazonas, who also play shoeless and in traditional attire and have helped upend sports culture in the Yucatán.“Here a woman serves the home and is not supposed to go out and play sports,” said Fabiola May Chulim, the team captain and manager of the Little Devils, known here as Las Diablillas, their name in Spanish. “When a woman marries, she’s supposed to do chores and attend to her husband and kids. We decided a few years ago that’s not going to impede us anymore from playing a sport when we want.”Four years ago, women in the team’s small community, Hondzonot, began playing a modified version of baseball in the afternoons. The idea was to get some exercise after completing household chores, and it grew from there. The Diablillas had no gloves and only a homemade bat whittled from wood. They played with a tennis ball. The game followed the rules of baseball, though as in kickball, a runner would be considered thrown out if struck with the ball.A women’s team in a nearby town also played the modified baseball game with a tennis ball and challenged the Diablillas to a match. The women of Hondzonot won, received 1,500 pesos (about $75) and uniforms, and were assigned a coach by the local municipality to teach them the rules of softball.Though they now had jerseys, the Hondzonot women preferred to play softball as they had before — barefoot and in huipil dresses, which they make themselves and wear often in the community. This decision would become the defining feature of the Diablillas, and it helped propel them to fame.“We wear the huipil with a lot of pride, and it is something that represents us as Mayan women,” May Chulim said. “We also aren’t accustomed to wearing shoes, and when we did we just got blisters. Why would we wear something that makes us uncomfortable?”As the Diablillas play more games, all friendlies because there is no established softball league for them, in the Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán, their fame in the region grows. Now, just a few years after learning the rules of softball, they have played in stadiums before thousands of fans, and their faces are on a mural in the nearby resort town Playa del Carmen. Last spring President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico invited May Chulim to appear at one of his daily news conferences in Mexico City.The team’s stardom has brought change in perceptions among men in the town. While members of the Diablillas used to request permission for something as simple as leaving the home, they now say they feel more liberated and empowered.“As we have improved on the field, my life has improved as well,” said Alicia Canul Dzib, who plays second base and pitches for the Diablillas. “I used to really only leave the house to help my husband with our crops. Now, thanks to softball, I have permission to leave the house, enjoy myself with friends and visit new towns. It motivates me to keep playing and set an example for my daughter.”The example set by the Diablillas has made women on the Yucatán Peninsula — and in the rest of the country — hopeful about more resources for a sport that, despite a fourth-place finish by the Mexican team at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, has received intermittent and limited support at a national level. Though for nearly a century Mexico has had a countrywide professional baseball league that at times features Major League Baseball players, women’s softball leagues are offered only at state and municipal levels.There is hope, however, that the popularity of the Diablillas and the Amazonas will represent a “watershed moment” for the growth of the sport in Mexico, Abel Fernández, president of the Quintana Roo state baseball association, said in a recent telephone interview.“It’s not common for Mayan or Indigenous women to be involved in sports in their communities, and the Diablillas are breaking those stereotypes,” Fernández said, adding that Quintana Roo had recently created a state softball association. “They’ve generated a lot of attention, and now we’re seeing a boom in interest in softball and sports among women in the region.”At a recent practice, the Amazonas, 15 players ages 15 to 64, communicated in a mix of Mayan and Spanish, roared with laughter and tossed the ball around the diamond as some of their goats bleated from the outfield, where they were tied to trees.Like the Diablillas, the Amazonas have become increasingly sought as opponents for teams of women who wear cleats and typical uniforms. And in July, the Amazonas were invited to appear on the field of the Yucatán Leones, the professional baseball organization based in Mérida, the state capital.The team captain, Fermina Dzid Dzul, said that since forming three years ago the team had fought to alter gender paradigms about sports participation in Yaxunah.“When I first started playing, the men in my family said jokes and comments like ‘You’re just wasting your time playing softball,’” said Alvi Yajaira Diaz Poot, who plays several positions for the Amazonas. “Now when I come home from games they are eager to know how the game went and even bring me something to drink.”And while the Amazonas and Diablillas know of each other and are aware of their similarities, neither is pushing for a head-to-head match to determine the best Mayan women’s softball team on the Yucatán Peninsula.They understand their success and inclusion in the sport mean that they have already both won."
48,Thor’s Exit: Noah Syndergaard Completes Deal With Angels,The oft-injured starter will try to re-establish himself in Los Angeles after a deal that netted the Mets a draft pick.,"Nov. 16, 2021","A healthy Noah Syndergaard may get back to the dominance he flashed as a young starting pitcher, but it won’t be with the Mets. The right-hander agreed to terms on a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday, joining a team that is long on star power but short on pitching.Syndergaard, 29, will give the Angels the pitcher with the highest upside in this year’s free-agent class, but one who also comes with a great risk. While the commitment is for only one year, Los Angeles paid a steep price, guaranteeing the hard-throwing Syndergaard $21 million and sacrificing a compensatory draft pick to the Mets, who had extended a qualifying offer that would have paid Syndergaard $18.4 million.The deal with the Angels, which was first reported by ESPN and MLB Network on Monday, was announced by the Angels on Tuesday after the completion of a physical.In a video posted on Twitter, Syndergaard thanked Mets fans for their support and talked about the process of deciding to move on.“This rehab and free agency process is both eye opening and humbling,” he said. “I was both flattered by all the outside interest yet couldn’t process what it would mean, or how hard it would be, to leave New York City. But after countless days of thought I feel signing with the Angels is the best fit for me at this point in my career.”Syndergaard joins a team that has two of the best players in baseball in Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani. After a fourth straight fourth-place finish in the American League West, Los Angeles is operating under something of an ultimatum because Ohtani, the two-way superstar, has intimated that the team needed to start winning to make him happy ahead of his free agency in 2024.Los Angeles has invested heavily in offense in recent years, with huge commitments to Trout and third baseman Anthony Rendon, but the team’s pitching has been patchwork at best. Ohtani, who was 9-2 with a 3.18 E.R.A. (in addition to hitting 46 home runs), was the team’s most effective starter and the only pitcher on the roster to surpass 100 innings in 2021.Trout endorsed the Syndergaard signing on Twitter, replying to a tweet about it with four fire emojis.At his best, Syndergaard could be the ace the team has lacked. He has a 3.32 E.R.A. over six seasons and has averaged 9.7 strikeouts per nine innings. As a rookie in 2015, he was pitching in the World Series. In 2016, he was an All-Star. But things have been far rockier since.Having bulked up considerably after the 2016 season, Syndergaard made only seven starts in 2017 because of a torn right latissimus muscle. And after uneven efforts in 2018 and 2019, he missed all of 2020 after having Tommy John surgery. Once he did return, he made only two token appearances in the final week of the 2021 season because of inflammation in his pitching elbow.While the Mets showed faith in Syndergaard by extending the qualifying offer, they did not appear to want to add more risk in terms of salary or years, allowing the pitcher they acquired from Toronto in 2012 as part of the R.A. Dickey trade to leave in return for only a draft pick, which will be around 70th overall.Showing an ability to laugh at himself, Syndergaard responded to a tweet by Jon Heyman of MLB Network, who had questioned whether Syndergaard was worth the risk of the qualifying offer, by sharing video of a scene from “Curb Your Enthusiasm” in which Larry David says, “Thanks for sharing that story.”"
49,"Ed Lucas, Blind Baseball Chronicler, Is Dead at 82","Sightless since 12, he became a baseball columnist and a radio reporter. He had a unique ability to know where a ball was hit by the sound of the crack of the bat.",,"The New York Giants had just won the 1951 pennant on Bobby Thomson’s walk-off home run against the Brooklyn Dodgers at the Polo Grounds when 12-year-old Ed Lucas raced out of his Jersey City apartment in the late afternoon to play baseball with his friends.Rarely asked to pitch because of his poor vision — he was legally blind — he took the mound when some of the other boys went home. He laid down his thick glasses — none of his favorite major league pitchers wore glasses, so why should he? — and uncorked a pitch with all his might.The batter swung. The ball struck Eddie between the eyes.“The twilight of an October afternoon on a makeshift baseball diamond as a white horsehide sphere shattered my fragile vision was the last clear thing I ever saw,” he wrote in “Seeing Home: The Ed Lucas Story: A Blind Broadcaster’s Story of Overcoming Life’s Obstacles” (2015, with his son Christopher). “The pain was overwhelming. Bright flashes obscured my sight.”His retinas were detached, and his vision deteriorated even further. He became fully blind on a day he would always remember: Dec. 11, 1951, when Joe DiMaggio retired.Although unable to see the diamond or the players on it, Mr. Lucas’s love of the game remained undiminished, displayed in a long career as a baseball writer for newspapers in New Jersey; as a radio broadcaster; and as a contributor to the website of the Yankees’ YES Network, for which he received a New York Emmy Award in 2009.He died on Nov. 10 in a hospital in Livingston, N.J. He was 82 and lived in nearby Union. The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, Christopher Lucas said.As Mr. Lucas recovered from unsuccessful surgery to reattach his retinas, his mother, Rosanna (Furey) Lucas, tried to raise Eddie’s spirits by writing letters to the Giants, Yankees and Dodgers, hoping that their players, coaches and broadcasters would offer to meet him and give him encouragement. Leo Durocher, the Giants’ manager, was among the first to respond, inviting Eddie to the Polo Grounds the next season.And when his mother learned that Phil Rizzuto, the Yankees’ shortstop, was working in the off-season at a men’s clothing store in Newark, N.J., she and her husband, Edward Sr., took Eddie to see him (and buy a suit) in November 1951; it started a friendship that lasted until Rizzuto’s death 56 years later.Edward Joseph Lucas Jr. was born prematurely on Jan. 3, 1939, in Jersey City, N.J.; insufficient oxygen had weakened his eyes, and he needed surgeries to deal with glaucoma and cataracts.His father had various jobs, including waiter, dockworker and pressman for The New York Times; his mother worked as a cashier and stocker at an A. & P. supermarket.After being blinded, Eddie attended St. Joseph’s School for the Blind in Jersey City and the New York Institute for the Education of the Blind in the Bronx (now the New York Institute for Special Education). At the institute, he formed a group of baseball fans who asked players to speak to his class; Jackie Robinson and Mickey Mantle were among those who accepted.He attended Seton Hall University, receiving a bachelor’s degree in communications in 1962. While a student there he hosted a show on the campus radio station, WSOU, that featured his interviews with baseball personalities.Mr. Lucas was often asked how a blind man could cover baseball. He cited a “unique sensory experience” — the ability to sense where a ball was hit by listening to the crack of the bat.“He would know if it was a fly ball to right field or a grounder to short,” said Harvey Zucker, a former sports editor of The Jersey Journal, who often accompanied Mr. Lucas to games.Mr. Lucas’s work first appeared in The Hudson Dispatch in 1958 as a high school stringer. He wrote for the paper as a freelancer until the mid-1960s, then started writing a column for The Journal. His last column appeared in July. He also contributed to Yankees Magazine.Mr. Lucas did not rely on play-by-play accounts in his writing or radio work. Instead, he focused on interviewing players, many of whom he befriended, like Mantle, Barry Bonds, Bernie Williams and Dave Righetti.He had been disappointed when he could not get hired as a sports reporter after graduating from Seton Hall. So he took a job as an insurance salesman and later worked as public relations director at Meadowview Psychiatric Hospital in Secaucus, N.J., and as an ambassador, fund-raiser and board member of the St. Joseph’s Home.In the 1980s, when his baseball work finally became a full-time pursuit, he had a weekly radio show on WMCA-AM that ran during the baseball season.He married Margaret Geraghty in 1965, and they had two sons, Edward and Christopher, but she left the family in 1972, which prompted Mr. Lucas’s sister, Maureen, and her husband, Jimmy, to move in with Mr. Lucas to help him care for the boys. Mr. Lucas and his wife divorced in 1973.In 1979, his former wife successfully sued for full custody of the children. Facing long odds as a blind man, he regained custody on appeal in Hudson County Superior Court.“I knew I was a good father,” he told The Record of Hackensack, N.J., in 1980. “Truth prevails as far as I’m concerned.”Mr. Lucas did most of his baseball work at Yankee Stadium, where on opening day in 1976 DiMaggio sat next to him in the press box, told him to put away the transistor radio and headset he needed to follow games, and delivered a personal play-by-play.Thirty years later, the Yankees owner, George M. Steinbrenner, gave his approval when Mr. Lucas asked that he be allowed to marry Allison Pfeifle on the field of Yankee Stadium a month before opening day. Mr. Steinbrenner paid for a dinner reception for 350 people at the stadium.“To paraphrase Mr. Gehrig,” Ms. Lucas said at a news conference after the ceremony, “I truly do consider ourselves the luckiest two people on the face of the earth.”In addition to his son Christopher, Mr. Lucas is survived by his wife, his other son, Eddie, and three grandsons.One day in 1965, Mr. Lucas was interviewing Ron Swoboda, then a rookie outfielder for the Mets, who asked him how he had lost his sight.“When I told him about my boyhood accident,” Mr. Lucas wrote in his autobiography, “he followed by asking me if anyone had ever taken me around a major league ballpark to describe it up close. I said no. I spent the next 45 minutes walking with Ron as he helped me better visualize Shea by running my hand along the outfield wall, touching the bases, and traveling the length of the warning track.”"
50,Cleveland Baseball Will Share ‘Guardians’ Name With Roller Derby Team,"The settlement of a federal lawsuit will allow the Major League Baseball franchise to move forward with renaming its team, amid a reckoning over symbols of racism.",,"Call it a shared guardianship.Cleveland’s Major League Baseball franchise and a local roller derby team announced on Tuesday that they had reached a settlement in a naming dispute that had escalated to a federal lawsuit. They will both be called the Guardians.The roller derby Cleveland Guardians sued the baseball team last month in U.S. District Court in Cleveland, accusing it of infringing on its trademark rights and identity as part of a renaming effort that made headlines.The lawsuit contended that the roller derby team had called itself the Cleveland Guardians since 2013 and had registered the name with the Ohio secretary of state in 2017, well before the baseball franchise’s longstanding name, the Indians, was thrust into the middle of a nationwide reckoning over symbols of racism.In a joint statement issued on Tuesday, the two sides said that they were pleased to announce an “amicable resolution” of the lawsuit.The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but the compromise is expected to allow the baseball team to move forward with its renaming process, which it announced last December.In July, the franchise said that it had chosen the name the Guardians, a nod to a set of winged Art Deco sculptures known as the Guardians of Traffic on the Hope Memorial Bridge that crosses the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland. The iconic sculptures, meant to symbolize progress, have gained reverence among residents of the area. The new name was unveiled in a video narrated by Tom Hanks, a longtime fan of the baseball team.On Tuesday, a spokesman for the baseball team declined to answer questions about further aspects of the name change, one that is expected to be completed by the 2022 season, and the release of licensed merchandise with the new name.At Progressive Field, the team’s ballpark in downtown Cleveland, workers removed an expansive script sign with the team’s former name from above the left-field scoreboard earlier this month.As of Tuesday, the ClevelandGuardians.com website still featured the roller derby team’s content, as did Facebook.com/ClevelandGuardians. The baseball team was still using Indians.com and MLB.com/Indians as its website, and the Twitter handle @indians.Christopher M. Pardo, a lawyer for the roller derby organization and the team itself, declined to comment further on the settlement on Tuesday.In the lawsuit, the roller derby team, which is based in the Cleveland suburb of Parma, Ohio, said it was “inconceivable” that a baseball franchise worth more than $1 billion would not have performed a Google search for the name Cleveland Guardians. If it did, the lawsuit said, it would have found the website for the roller derby team, which operates as a nonprofit organization.“Economic might, however, does not make legal right,” the lawsuit said. “There cannot be two ‘Cleveland Guardians’ teams in Cleveland, and, to be blunt, plaintiff was here first.”The lawsuit accused the baseball team of surreptitiously filing a trademark application in April for the Cleveland Guardians name in Mauritius, a small East African island nation, to hide the paperwork.In June, the lawsuit said, the owner of the roller derby team was presented with a “nominal” offer by the baseball franchise after he said that he would consider selling the naming rights and the domain name for ClevelandGuardians.com. The baseball team never responded to his counteroffer, according to the lawsuit.At the time that lawsuit was filed, the baseball team said in a statement: “We believe there is no conflict between the parties and their ability to operate in their respective business areas.”Under mounting pressure from Native Americans and other groups, Cleveland’s baseball team said last year that it would abandon the name that it had used for more than a century. The killing of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis last year became a catalyst for sweeping changes to the names and symbols used by institutions, including that of Washington’s National Football League team.Facing similar criticism that its name was racist and demeaning, Washington’s franchise announced in July 2020 that it would rename itself. It still has not yet publicly revealed a new name, calling itself the Washington Football Team."
51,No Surprises as Arozarena and India Win Rookie of the Year Awards,Tampa Bay’s Randy Arozarena and Cincinnati’s Jonathan India stood out in a deep rookie class for both leagues.,"Nov. 15, 2021","They came into this season with wildly different levels of major league experience, but outfielder Randy Arozarena of the Tampa Bay Rays and second baseman Jonathan India of the Cincinnati Reds are leaving it the same way, with each being named the winner of his league’s Rookie of the Year Award on Monday.The awards, which are given annually by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, hardly came as a surprise: Arozarena (4.1) and India (3.9) were the top rookies in the majors in wins above replacement and each played a central role in his team’s success this year.Arozarena, who led American League rookies in hits (145), runs (94), doubles (32), stolen bases (20) and on-base plus slugging percentage (.815) received 22 first-place votes, beating out his fellow finalists, pitcher Luis Garcia of the Houston Astros and shortstop Wander Franco of the Rays, each of whom received two. Adolis García of the Texas Rangers got three first-place votes but was not a finalist because Garcia and Franco received more second-place votes.India, who led National League rookies in runs (98), doubles (34), runs batted in (69), walks (71) and O.P.S. (.835), received 29 of 30 first-place votes. He beat out his fellow finalists, pitcher Trevor Rogers of the Miami Marlins, who received the other first-place vote, and outfielder Dylan Carlson of the St. Louis Cardinals, who received three second-place votes and 13 third-place votes.Arozarena is the fourth Rays player to win the Rookie of Year Award. India is the eighth Reds player to win it — a fraternity that includes the Hall of Famers Frank Robinson and Johnny Bench, as well as Pete Rose.For Arozarena, 26, the only surprising thing about the award was the fact that he was still eligible to receive it. The dynamic outfielder had played a starring role in Tampa Bay’s run to the World Series in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, hitting .377 with 10 home runs in 20 postseason games. But that performance came after a total of only 84 regular-season at-bats over the 2019 and 2020 seasons, thus preserving his rookie eligibility.He backed up his postseason breakout by being one of the central figures of a team that won 100 games in 2021. While the Rays were eliminated by the Boston Red Sox in a division series, Arozarena and Franco showed their value in that short series, with Arozarena executing a rare straight steal of home.“I know I was favored to be the rookie of the year,” Arozarena said through a translator on Monday. “But for me, my mind wasn’t set on the award or winning the award. My mind and my goal was to have another good season and continue what I had done the year before.”Franco, 20, was the youngest of the finalists, and had the least time in the majors, but he managed to produce 3.5 WAR in only 70 games, most of them at shortstop. He reached base in 43 consecutive games, which tied him with Robinson for the longest streak in A.L. or N.L. history by a player 20 years old or younger. Garcia, whose shimmying windup for the Astros made him stand out in the postseason, was the A.L.’s best rookie starter, with a 3.48 E.R.A. and 2.6 WAR.While India, 24, did not come into the season with Arozarena’s postseason résumé or hype, he was nearly as good, establishing himself as Cincinnati’s leadoff hitter and its most valuable position player in terms of WAR. The No. 5 pick in the 2018 draft, India rode a strong spring training to a spot on the Reds’ opening day roster. When he made his major league debut by starting at second base in the first game of the season, he became the first rookie second baseman for the Reds to do so since Rose in 1963.“I said at the beginning of the year, you know, this was my goal, this was my personal goal,” India said during a video call with MLB Network. “And I don’t set many personal goals for myself, I just had a feeling this is what I wanted.”For the voters, that was enough to trump Carlson’s defensive versatility and 3.2 WAR and the solid pitching from Rogers, whose won-lost record of 7-8 for the Marlins obscured a terrific season in which he had a 2.64 E.R.A. and 3.5 WAR.Rookie classes can vary wildly in terms of quality, but 2021 offered quite a few players with much promise besides the six finalists. Among them were batters like García of the Rangers, who hit 31 homers and had 3.8 WAR, and Patrick Wisdom of the Chicago Cubs, who hit 28 homers with an .823 O.P.S.Top starting pitchers included Alek Manoah of the Toronto Blue Jays (9-2, 3.22 E.R.A.) and Ian Anderson of the Atlanta Braves, who had a solid regular season (9-5, 3.58 E.R.A.) and flirted with a no-hitter in the World Series.The top rookie reliever was Garrett Whitlock of the Boston Red Sox, a Rule 5 draft pick whom Boston selected from the Yankees. He had a 1.96 E.R.A. and 81 strikeouts in 46 appearances."
52,Baseball Gets Another Chance to Honor a Legend,,"Nov. 15, 2021","Minnie Miñoso was a mentor for generations of Chicago White Sox players. He served many years as a player and a coach, lived year-round in the city and upheld the team’s tradition as a welcoming place for Cuban stars. He liked to offer this advice:“Be in love with the game,” Miñoso said by phone in 2014. “Do everything beautiful for the game and the people and the country you represent. That’s what I want everyone to do.”When Miñoso died the next year, he was as young as 89 or as old as 92 — depending on your source — and his place in baseball history was just as confusing. Was he mostly a solid hitter with speed in the 1950s? Was he mainly a carnival act for Bill Veeck, the maverick White Sox owner, who briefly activated him in 1976 and 1980?Or was Miñoso one of the best and most important players in baseball history?“To me, Minnie is a legend,” the former pitcher Jose Contreras, who came to the majors from Cuba in 2003, said through an interpreter on Monday. “He was one of the reasons I started playing baseball when I was a kid. I wanted to be like him. He was one of our best representatives, our Jackie Robinson.”The Hall of Fame is considering Miñoso again this off-season, reviving one of its most curious candidacies. In addition to the annual writers’ ballot — which will feature David Ortiz and Alex Rodriguez for the first time and Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens for the last — two committees will pore over 20 names from the past.Miñoso is on the Golden Days ballot for candidates from the 1950s and 1960s. But his record crosses over to the other ballot — Early Baseball — which is largely evaluating Black players from the era before integration. Miñoso came to the United States in 1945, inspired by Robinson’s signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and spent three years in the Negro National League, helping the New York Cubans win a championship.“I can’t even count the number of times that he and I sat in the conference room adjacent to my office, just talking baseball and talking about life and the joy that he had for this game and why he chose to pass up more lucrative opportunities to come play for the New York Cubans,” said Bob Kendrick, the president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City. “He wanted to chase the American dream, and he laid down that foundation to so many others, because they knew they would have the opportunity to play this game.”Many light-skinned players from Cuba had appeared in the majors before Miñoso’s debut in 1949 for Veeck’s Cleveland Indians. Miñoso, however, was dark-skinned. He faced the same kind of racism directed at Robinson and other Black players, without the same command of English to help him get by.Miñoso was hit by pitches 16 times in 1951, his first full season, and led the majors in that category nine times. He was comfortable crowding the plate, to be sure, but suspected there was more behind it.“My first year in big league in 1951, one team — I no tell who — always call me names,” he once told The New York World-Telegram and Sun, which quoted him in broken English, as recounted in Jay Jaffe’s “The Cooperstown Casebook” in 2017. They used foul language and referenced his race, Miñoso said, adding: “I think they try make me afraid.”Miñoso persevered. From 1951 through 1961, he ranked third in the majors in hits, trailing only Nellie Fox and Richie Ashburn. Miñoso had more steals and a better on-base plus slugging percentage than both.Fox and Ashburn are Hall of Famers. So, of course, are Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays and Stan Musial, the only everyday players who matched Miñoso in batting average (.300), on-base percentage (.390) and slugging percentage (.450) in that 11-year prime.Miñoso’s value is reflected in his wins above replacement, as calculated by Baseball Reference. Dozens of Hall of Famers — from Earl Averill and Hack Wilson in the 1930s to Jim Rice and Kirby Puckett in the 1980s — trail Miñoso’s total of 53.8 WAR.“There are Hall of Famers that have less than that, if we’re looking at the new numbers,” said the former major leaguer Eduardo Perez, whose father, Tony Perez, is a Hall of Famer from Cuba who idolized Miñoso.“If we’re looking at the analytics as far as on-base percentage and O.P.S., those numbers also belong. But most importantly, making the organization better is what it’s all about, and Minnie Miñoso belongs in the Hall of Fame because of all those little things that he did to make his teammates better.”Miñoso’s trade to Chicago in 1951 sparked a White Sox revival that culminated in 1959 with the franchise’s first World Series appearance in 40 years. Miñoso made his mark on that team in absentia; he had been dealt back to Cleveland for Early Wynn, who won the majors’ Cy Young Award in that 1959 season.Maybe if Miñoso had starred in the World Series, or won a batting title or a Most Valuable Player Award, he would have gained more attention from Hall of Fame voters. The writers virtually ignored him in 1969, and because of those cameos in 1976 and 1980 (which made him a five-decade player), Miñoso did not regain his Hall of Fame eligibility until the mid-1980s.By then, many voters had never seen him play, or they knew him mainly for the comebacks. Miñoso lingered on the ballot through 1999, peaking at 21.1 percent in 1988, far below the 75 percent needed for election. Later committees have not been much kinder; in 2006, Miñoso was passed over in a broad vote on Negro Leaguers, because his time in Major League Baseball could not be considered.This year may be different. In 2020, M.L.B. formally recognized several of the Negro leagues as on par with the American and National Leagues, a long-overdue decision that has expanded the official record books. Miñoso’s statistics were not exactly hidden before, but the new context can only help.Miñoso hit .351 across the 1947 and 1948 seasons for the Cubans, and then Veeck bought his contract rights for $15,000. Cleveland was loaded with talent, so Miñoso spent most of 1949 and 1950 dominating the Pacific Coast League. By all rights, he should have been continuing his career as an elite major leaguer, which would have strengthened his Cooperstown case.“It should have happened when he was still with us, and I know how much it meant to him,” Kendrick said of the possibility of Miñoso’s being elected to the Hall of Fame, adding later: “I just think we have a chance to get it right this time. We’re here as an institution to continually try to educate people about these legendary ballplayers who built the bridge. Minnie was one of those bridge builders, and those who become bridge builders in our society have a very special place. Minnie Miñoso did that.”"
53,California’s High School Football Powerhouses Feed the College Game,,"Nov. 14, 2021","BELLFLOWER, Calif. — The scent of seared carne asada wafted through the parking lot on a Friday evening last month at St. John Bosco High, an all-boys school tucked in the southeast corner of Los Angeles County.An overflow crowd of 6,000 — some hanging over railings, others sitting on $75 end zone bar stools with table service — packed into Panish Family Stadium, a $7.2 million football stadium with a state-of-the-art video board. A machine spewed fog, lights flashed and a D.J. cranked Metallica’s “Enter Sandman” as the home team, in its glittering metallic gold helmets, charged through an inflatable tunnel and onto the field.All of it was the preamble to another spectacle: a clash between two teams, St. John Bosco and Santa Ana Mater Dei, that are making high school football look more and more like the Division I college game.The two Catholic schools, rivals in the Trinity League, have split the last four state championships in California’s top division, and each has won two mythical national titles in the previous eight seasons. But this rivalry stands out for another reason: St. John Bosco and Mater Dei are locked in an arms race to garner the best high school players from one of the country’s most fertile talent pools. The quaint ideal of suiting up for a neighborhood school has given way as some players make hourslong commutes to further their football ambitions.These two football programs — with their ballooning coaching staffs, cutting-edge weight rooms, nationally televised games against out-of-state opponents, productive fund-raising and nonexistent attendance boundaries — are so attractive to recruits because when Mater Dei and St. John Bosco play, pretty much anyone who steps on the field will one day become a college football player.The schools have sent 130 players to Division I colleges over the last five years, according to MaxPreps, a website that covers high school sports, and more than 60 players on this year’s teams have offers to play in college — from Army to Alabama. Neither team has lost to another California school since 2015.Kevin Pearson, the coach at Warren High School in Downey, two miles up the road, was asked if his team, which went unbeaten in the regular season with one of the top junior quarterbacks in the country, Nicholaus Iamaleava Jr., could compete with St. John Bosco or Mater Dei.Pearson laughed. He said he’d had eight players transfer from St. John Bosco in the last two years. None had started at St. John Bosco, but seven started for him. “Does that give you a good idea of what would happen?” he said.The concentration of talent in two Catholic schools 24 miles apart mirrors what has happened in college football, where name-brand powers are no longer content to recruit in their backyards — and where the talent gap between a handful of perennial playoff teams and everyone else is becoming a chasm. According to the database of the recruiting site 247Sports, more than half the nation’s five-star recruits in the last five years (82 of 163) have signed with four colleges: Alabama, Ohio State, Georgia and Clemson.“What you’re seeing in Southern California is the exact same thing,” said Jason Negro, the coach at St. John Bosco.This migration to St. John Bosco and Mater Dei has been driven in part by parents who are willing to explore any avenue to help their children — particularly if they show signs of being elite athletes. But these two schools will also go to extraordinary lengths to woo prospects. They have created pipelines to youth football programs, offered increased financial aid, built active social media channels and, in Mater Dei’s case, provided vans that shuttle players through the rush-hour freeway crunch, west to Los Angeles and east to Riverside County.“This is basically a college football program in high school,” said C.J. Williams, a senior wide receiver at Mater Dei who has committed to Notre Dame.Earnest Greene III, a senior offensive tackle at St. John Bosco who has taken recruiting visits to Georgia, Ohio State and Texas in recent weeks, cited an example. “When we’re installing plays, we might watch film of how Alabama ran it,” he said, aware that his coaches have open invitations to sit in video rooms of the top college programs during the off-season. It wasn’t always this way.A little more than a decade ago, St. John Bosco was at a crossroads. Enrollment, which had peaked in 2001, had plummeted by one-third to fewer than 700 in the wake of the Great Recession. “We were on the ropes,” said Paul Escala, who was hired as St. John Bosco’s president in 2010 and is now the superintendent of schools for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.The school decided football could be its salvation.Escala asked the alumni to bet on a vision of St. John Bosco as a college prep school — in the arts, academics and athletics. It would rely on data to target students who could afford a premium education and would be more strategic in delivering financial aid. “That was music to my ears,” said Negro, who was hired months before Escala.Negro’s model mirrored that of a college program. He ramped up fund-raising, established passing league programs (60 percent of the Braves roster are alumni) and “jumped two feet in” establishing a talent pipeline from youth tackle football programs. After just four years, the Braves, led by quarterback Josh Rosen, a future first-round N.F.L. draft pick, went 16-0, won a state title and were crowned national champions.A sign of how things had changed came when Negro’s phone rang at the team banquet after that season: The caller was a high school quarterback from Florida who was interested in transferring.Now the Braves play most of their nonleague schedule against teams from outside California. They have traveled to Hawaii, Ohio, New Jersey, Florida and Washington, D.C., in recent years, and this season visited Chesapeake, Va., where they throttled Oscar Smith High School, the top-ranked team in the state, 49-0.As St. John Bosco began its ascent, Bruce Rollinson, the coach at Mater Dei, feared becoming a dinosaur. Now 72, Rollinson is a gravel-voiced, sharp-tongued throwback. He still requires his players to arrive at the start of training camp with a buzz cut — or their teammates will do the shearing for them. On game days, players wear dress shirts and ties to school. In 2011, Mater Dei missed the playoffs for the only time in Rollinson’s 33 years as the head coach. Though quarterbacks still showed up at the school every summer — John Huarte and Matt Leinart would go on to win Heisman Trophies in college — burly linemen and tackle-busting running backs no longer did.“I thought if I’m going to ride this thing through, I need to make some changes,” Rollinson said. He brought in a nutritionist, and a committee raised money for everything from equipment (the Monarchs have four different uniforms) to air travel (they opened this season at Duncanville, Texas) and increased scholarship aid. And a coach once dismissive of technology turned loose his daughter, Catherine, who is his chief of staff, to build a presence on social media. Mater Dei football’s Instagram account now has more than 33,000 followers.“When people see something with Mater Dei on it, unfortunately they don’t say, ‘Oh, that’s that academic school’ or ‘That’s the great performing arts school,’” said Rollinson, who played at the school in the 1960s. “They say, ‘That’s the football power.’ I needed to get the brand out there.”The Monarchs rebooted and were contending for titles again, but they couldn’t get past St. John Bosco. Amid a string of six consecutive losses to their rival, Rollinson called Negro at the end of the 2014 season. “He just said, ‘Listen, how are you doing it?’” Negro said.Rollinson’s takeaway was that Mater Dei needed to immerse itself in the world of youth football. That meant adding mostly younger assistants who could oversee passing league teams and develop relationships with youth football coaches who — as in the world of grass-roots basketball — can influence where elite players go to school.Among those he added to his coaching staff was the Mater Dei alumnus Pat Dubar, a pony-tailed former punk rock singer who upon returning from living in Sweden co-founded the OG Ducks, a powerhouse youth football program in Riverside County. His title, along with linebackers coach, is director of player personnel.“When you lose big to Centennial and Bosco, you see these guys on the other team and it’s like playing Alabama,” Dubar said, referring to Corona Centennial, which had knocked Mater Dei out of the playoffs in consecutive seasons. He added, “I can bring in those players.”The next season, a freshman quarterback, J.T. Daniels, now at Georgia, and a sophomore receiver, Amon-Ra St. Brown, now with the Detroit Lions, were among the new arrivals who would eventually help Mater Dei win national championships in 2017 and 2018. They both had played for the Ducks.When Daniels graduated high school a year early, Bryce Young, now at Alabama, transferred in to replace him.Pearson, the Warren High School coach, had been Young’s coach for two years at Cathedral High School in Los Angeles. “If my son was the starting quarterback,” he said, “and Mater Dei was coming off a national championship and said, ‘Here’s the keys to the Ferrari,’ it would have been hard to tell him to stay here.”Eoghan Kerry would watch Mater Dei on television from his home in Bakersfield, at the bottom end of California’s Central Valley, where he had begun playing football in high school. When the pandemic hit, near the end of his sophomore season, Kerry persuaded his mother, Erin Miller, to let him transfer to Mater Dei, believing that it might help him earn a college scholarship.For five months, Miller woke at 3 a.m. and drove her son 150 miles down Interstate 5 to Santa Ana, then found a spot in Mater Dei’s solar-panel-covered parking lot and went about her work as a history professor for Bakersfield Community College. In the evening, they made the three-hour drive home with her son asleep while she listened to books.“You want to make nice stable choices for your life and your kids,” said Miller, who has since rented out her home in Bakersfield and found an apartment in Laguna Hills, about 20 miles south of Mater Dei. “In some ways, I’ve been risk averse, but I don’t want him to live his life that way. I knew I’d never regret this.”And she hasn’t. Kerry, a 6-foot-4, 230-pound linebacker, committed to Texas after playing only five games in the spring after high school sports in California were wiped out last fall by the coronavirus pandemic. He expects the experience to help him next summer, when he will again have a new town, a new playbook and new teammates.“It was a difficult transition socially,” Kerry said. “I wasn’t accepted by everyone at first. But I was here to get to the next step in my career and not make friends. I put my head down and I think the guys respected me.”When Mater Dei began bringing in more players from farther afield — from Moreno Valley to the northeast, Temecula to the southeast and Los Angeles to the west — Rollinson arranged for vans that school employees living near those areas could drive to and from the campus each day. As many as a dozen players ride in the vans.Josh Hunter, a senior safety from Temecula, 70 miles from the school, said the van was a significant factor in his choosing Mater Dei over St. John Bosco, which was even farther away. “There’s some bad days, for sure, where you’re tired and your best friend from the neighborhood can walk to school,” said Hunter, who is the son of the former Atlanta Braves first baseman Brian Hunter and is considering playing both baseball and football at San Diego State. “But my goal was to go to college for free — that was the big push.”The day before Mater Dei and St. John Bosco met, Myron Williams, a 52-year-old father, stood in an end zone at Panish Family Stadium, watching the schools’ freshman teams play. His placement was strategic — at halftime, parents from both sides passed him to ask why he wasn’t sitting on their side.His son, Madden, a promising eighth-grade receiver who wants to play in high school, is trying to decide between St. John Bosco and Mater Dei.“It’s no different than looking at colleges,” Myron Williams said. “If you have N.F.L. aspirations, you’re not going to play at an N.A.I.A. school. As a parent, I know there’s no magic pill, but these are the best coaches and the best players, so if you’re going through that for four years, you would hope to be better prepared for the chance to play in college.”The next night provided a hint of what lies ahead for those freshmen. More than a dozen college coaches roamed the sideline, keeping their eyes on prospects. Of all the elite talent on the field, it was Elijah Brown, Mater Dei’s slight sophomore quarterback, who shined brightest, coolly delivering a variety of throws on target.The score was tied at halftime but Mater Dei thwarted St. John Bosco twice on downs near its goal line and eased to a 42-21 victory. Matayo Uiagalelei, a 6-foot-5, 254-pound junior tight end and defensive end whose brother D.J. is the starting quarterback at Clemson, was kicking himself for dropping three passes. “I’m going to put that on me,” Uiagalelei said of the loss.But there was solace for the home team. The last four seasons, the team that had lost in the regular season had avenged that defeat on the way to a state title. “I love a humbling experience,” said Greene, the big lineman, who fully expected a chance to set things right down the road."
54,"Sam Huff, Fearsome Hall of Fame Giants Linebacker, Dies at 87","Huff, who became the epitome of the rough-and-tough football star with New York, was remembered for his head-on duels with two of the game’s greatest fullbacks.","Published Nov. 13, 2021","Sam Huff, the Giants’ Hall of Fame middle linebacker who became the face of pro football, his feats celebrated in the national news media when the N.F.L. began to vie with major league baseball as America’s No. 1 sport, died on Saturday in Winchester, Va. He was 87.His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by his daughter, Catherine Huff Myers, who said Huff learned he had dementia in 2013.Playing for the Giants in their glory years of the late 1950s and early ’60s, Huff came out of the West Virginia coal country to anchor a defense that gained the kind of renown that had previously been reserved for strong-armed quarterbacks and elusive runners.He played in six N.F.L. championship games in his eight seasons with the Giants. He was named to the all-league team three times and played in five Pro Bowls.Huff was remembered for his head-on duels with two of the game’s greatest fullbacks — the Cleveland Browns’ Jim Brown and the Green Bay Packers’ Jim Taylor — but he also had 30 career interceptions. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1982.Yankee Stadium, the Giants’ home at the time, reverberated to chants of “DEE-fense” and “Huff, Huff, Huff” in the late 1950s as one of the N.F.L.’s oldest teams became a glamorous franchise, vying with the baseball Yankees for media acclaim in America’s communications capital.Huff became the epitome of the rough-and-tough football star.On Nov. 30, 1959 — almost a year after the thrilling sudden-death N.F.L. title game between the Giants and Baltimore Colts had launched pro football’s ascendancy — Time magazine placed a portrait of Huff on its cover. He was the focus of “A Man’s Game,” an article in that issue about pro football.Huff’s fearsome aura was sealed on Oct. 30, 1960, when Walter Cronkite narrated the CBS documentary “The Violent World of Sam Huff,” part of the series “The Twentieth Century.”A microphone and a transmitter had been placed on Huff’s shoulder pads for an exhibition game against the Chicago Bears in Toronto the previous August.Viewers saw and heard Huff calling signals in the huddle, then threatening a Bears receiver he considered to be taking liberties with him. “You do that again, you’ll get a broken nose,” Huff warned. “Don’t hit me on the chin with your elbow. I’m not going to warn you no more.”Burton Benjamin, the documentary’s producer, later recalled in an article for The New York Times that the “violent world” reference “quickly became a part of the football lexicon.”As Frank Gifford, the Giants’ Hall of Fame running back and receiver, put it in his memoir “The Whole Ten Yards,” Huff became “a household name.”Robert Lee Huff — he could not recall how he came to be called Sam — was born on Oct. 4, 1934, in Morgantown, W.Va., the son of a coal miner. He grew up in a mining camp known as Number Nine, outside Farmington, W.Va.Huff was an All-American at West Virginia University, a 6-foot-1-inch, 230-pound guard and tackle on both offense and defense. The Giants selected him in the third round of the 1956 N.F.L. draft.As a rookie, Huff played in the Giants’ 47-7 victory over the Bears in the 1956 N.F.L. championship game, and he became a key figure in the 4-3 alignment — four down linemen and three linebackers — installed by the Giants’ defensive coordinator, Tom Landry. Replacing the 5-2 scheme commonly used, it put Huff at the heart of the action.“Before, I always had my head down, looking right into the center’s helmet,” Huff recalled in his memoir “Tough Stuff” (1988, with Leonard Shapiro). “Now I was standing up and I could see everything, and I mean everything. I always had outstanding peripheral vision. It’s one of the reasons I was so perfectly suited for the position.”The Giants’ outstanding defensive linemen — Roosevelt Grier and Dick Modzelewski at tackle, Andy Robustelli and Jim Katcavage at end — kept blockers away from Huff, helping him to stop running plays. And he ranged back or moved toward the sidelines to break up passes, complementing the superb defensive backs Emlen Tunnell, Jim Patton and Dick Nolan.Huff “almost single-handedly influenced the first chants of ‘Defense, Defense’ in Yankee Stadium,” John K. Mara, the Giants’ president and chief executive, said in a statement on Saturday.Following their championship season of 1956, the Giants won five division titles between 1958 and 1963, but they lost in the championship game each time.The Giants decided to reshape a veteran team following the 1963 season, when they won a third consecutive division title. They traded Huff to Washington for Dick James, a smallish running back, and Andy Stynchula, a defensive end.Huff was shocked and angered, and the two players acquired by the Giants did little for them. As the Giants’ aging stars departed, the team descended into mediocrity. Huff gained retribution with Washington’s 72-41 victory over the Giants in November 1966, which he once called “the one game I wanted the most.”He played for Washington from 1964 to 1967, then retired, but he came back for a final season as a player and linebacker coach when Vince Lombardi was named Washington’s head coach in 1969.Huff was later a longtime radio broadcaster for Washington games and a marketing executive for the Marriott hotel and resort chain. He also bred thoroughbred horses.Besides his daughter, Catherine, he is survived by his partner, Carol Holden; a son, Joseph; his former wife, Mary Helen Fletcher Huff; three grandchildren; and a great-grandchild, the family said. Another son, Robert Jr., died in 2018. Huff’s marriage ended in divorce in the late 1980s.For anyone unfamiliar with “The Violent World of Sam Huff,” the man in the middle of the Giants’ awesome defense underlined his credo in a 2002 interview for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.“I never let up on anybody,” Huff said. “I don’t think I ever quit on a play. If you had the football, I was going to hit you, and when I hit you, I tried to hit you hard enough to hurt you. That’s the way the game should be played.”"
55,"To Keep Ohtani Happy, the Angels Have a Simple Directive: Win","With Shohei Ohtani issuing what felt like an ultimatum, and Mike Trout’s prime fleeting, Perry Minasian has his work cut out for him to build around his superstars.","Published Nov. 12, 2021","CARLSBAD, Calif. — As autumn extended from leaves changing to leaves falling, Perry Minasian, the general manager of the Los Angeles Angels, was besieged with questions from his children. Why, the kids wanted to know, are our grandparents visiting Uncle Zack and Uncle Calvin but not us?The answer was easy. The Minasians are a baseball family. Zack is the pro scouting director for the San Francisco Giants, and the Giants won the National League West and were playing the Los Angeles Dodgers in a division series. Calvin is the director of clubhouse and equipment for the Atlanta Braves, and his 2021 ride went all the way to the World Series title. So the brothers’ parents, Zack and Barbara, spent October and early November crisscrossing the country cheering for two of their four sons. (Another brother, Rudy, 42, has his own law firm in Chicago.)Perry, the third baseball son, chuckled as he recounted this while standing on the back veranda of the hotel where M.L.B.’s general managers meetings were held this month. He and his family were left out of Grandpa and Grandma’s itinerary because the Angels, as usual, were left out of the postseason.Now, as Minasian, 40, plans for his second year of running the Angels’ baseball operations, there remain more questions than answers, some far more pointed than others, starting with this: Is the organization that fumbled away much of Mike Trout’s prime going to do the same with Shohei Ohtani?“I’m worried about the organization, putting the organization in the best place to succeed,” Minasian said. “I wake up thinking about it and I go to bed thinking about it. That’s No. 1. It’s not about Mike Trout. It’s not about Shohei Ohtani. I may be the first person to tell you that. It’s about the team. The collective group and achieving something together. That’s what I spend my energy on.”Ohtani is widely expected to win the American League Most Valuable Player Award on Thursday. If he does, it would give the Angels four M.V.P.s in the past eight years, as Trout won in 2014, 2016 and 2019.In those eight seasons, the Angels have won zero playoff games, made just one postseason appearance and, in the other seven years, finished a combined 131 games out of first place.Trout turned 30 in August during a frustrating season in which a calf tear limited him to 36 games, a career low. Ohtani, after battling injuries during his first three seasons with the Angels, finally was healthy in 2021 and produced one of the most remarkable seasons in baseball history, starring both as a hitter and as a pitcher.But he also seemed to put the organization on notice after the Angels finished fourth in a five-team A.L. West, just as it had in each of his first three seasons. After the home finale he said, via his translator: “I really like the team. I love the fans. I love the atmosphere of the team. But, more than that, I want to win. That’s the biggest thing for me. I’ll leave it at that.”The comments immediately brought out the speculators: Is Ohtani angling for a trade? Is he threatening to leave via free agency when he becomes eligible after the 2023 season?Minasian and Nez Balelo, Ohtani’s agent, each emphasized in Carlsbad that the answer to the first question is no, that Ohtani is happy playing in Anaheim. (“Extremely happy,” Balelo said.) The answer to the second question is unknowable this far in advance simply because there is so much time and so much could happen. And that starts with Minasian this winter as he works toward fixing a team that now has had six consecutive losing seasons.Minasian and Ohtani have spoken multiple times since Ohtani made those comments.“We’ve had conversations about all kinds of things,” Minasian said. “He’s an impressive guy on and off the field. One thing he has an eye for is talent. I call him and ask him about players. Absolutely. He’s got a good idea about what plays and what doesn’t.”Minasian did not reveal which potential free agents or trade targets he may have discussed with Ohtani, but it is no secret what the Angels need: pitching. Their rotation ranked 22nd in the majors this summer with a 4.78 E.R.A. and 29th in each of the two previous seasons (5.52 during the 60-game season of 2020 and 5.64 in 2019).Free agency probably will be an easier route for the Angels than trades given that they do not appear to be deep in prospects. Baseball America ranked the Angels’ farm system 25th in the majors in its 2021 midseason rankings.There are just-past-their-prime potential Hall of Famers on the free agent market this winter like Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander and Clayton Kershaw. There are pitchers who lived up to their potential this year and are in discussion for the Cy Young Awards (Robbie Ray and Kevin Gausman) and others who are still working toward it (Marcus Stroman, Carlos Rodon, Jon Gray). Ohtani’s Japanese countryman Yusei Kikuchi is a free agent. Top potential trade targets for those seeking starting pitching might be Sonny Gray and Luis Castillo (Cincinnati), and Sean Manaea, Frankie Montas and Chris Bassitt (Oakland).“There’s a certain type of personality we’re looking for on the mound to fit with what we currently have to kind of set the tone,” Minasian said, noting that one desired quality is aggressiveness and that “it is not just about taking the ball and throwing 100 pitches. We want players that make other guys better around them.”In addition to collecting 46 homers and 100 R.B.I. at the plate while stealing 26 bases in 2021, Ohtani was also the Angels’ best starter, going 9-2 with a 3.18 E.R.A. and 156 strikeouts over 130 and a third innings pitched over 23 starts.“I feel pretty confident that I could repeat what I did this year,” Ohtani said at the World Series last month in Houston while receiving the Commissioner’s Historic Achievement Award. “I just need to get out there and play every day and leave the numbers, put up good numbers, and I think I’ll be able to at least have a similar season as this year.”“Amen,” Minasian said, smiling broadly, when those comments were relayed. “Let’s see it.”Ohtani right now is back home in Japan, Balelo said, his off-season workouts already underway. Neither the agent nor the general manager would comment on whether they had engaged in talks regarding a contract extension. Ohtani is scheduled to make $5.5 million in 2022, the second year of a two-year, $8.5 million deal, after which he would be eligible for arbitration for a year ahead of free agency.Both Minasian and Balelo agree that, above all, Ohtani wants to win. He already has proved he is about more than just money by choosing to move from Japan to M.L.B. in the winter of 2017-18 just as new posting rules went into effect. He left millions on the table by not waiting two more years, until he turned 25, to come to the United States.The Angels have not been disappointed, especially when Ohtani, 27, is healthy.“As good as he is on the field, the off-the-field stuff is what really impresses me,” Minasian said. “His interaction with teammates, his ability to make adjustments. His dedication to his craft.”Now, the burden is on Minasian to put Ohtani in position to win.“I know a lot was made about his comments,” Minasian said. “I think if you ask everyone else in the clubhouse, I don’t know any major league player who doesn’t want to win. If you do, show me one and let me talk to him. I’d be surprised. I was not surprised by what he said.”Time will tell whether it was the frustration of a losing season talking, or a veiled ultimatum. With sweeping views of the resort golf course and gently rolling hills as a backdrop as he talked in Carlsbad, Minasian said his siblings teased him all fall about being the only brother who wasn’t participating in the postseason. With a productive winter, he could both end that razzing and make Ohtani happy, the priorities, perhaps, not necessarily falling in that order."
56,"Pedro Feliciano, Durable Relief Pitcher for the Mets, Dies at 45","He led the major leagues in appearances from 2008 to 2010, earning him the nickname Perpetual Pedro.",,"Pedro Feliciano, a relief pitcher who was the workhorse of the Mets’ bullpen for five years — including three straight seasons in which he led the major leagues in appearances, earning him the nickname Perpetual Pedro — died on Monday at his home in Puerto Rico. He was 45.The Mets announced his death. No cause was given, but Feliciano had learned in 2013 that he had a rare genetic heart condition.Feliciano, a left-hander, joined the Mets after seven years in the minor leagues and went on to spend his entire nine-year major league career with them. He won 22 games, lost 21 and had a 3.33 earned run average in a career that stretched from 2002 to 2013. He pitched a total of 484 games, the second most in Mets history after the 695 appearances by the All-Star reliever John Franco.Feliciano was used primarily against left-handed hitters and held them to a .211 average, but he was not just a left-handed specialist. “When you talk about relievers in baseball, in my mind, he’s at the top because he can get out both lefties and righties,” the Mets’ general manager, Omar Minaya, said in 2007.Feliciano led the majors in games pitched with 86 in 2008, 88 in 2009 and 92 in 2010 — a single-season total that had previously been exceeded only three times in major league history. From 2006 to 2010, he appeared in 408 games and had a 3.09 E.R.A.His best season was 2006, when the Mets finished first in the National League East: He posted a 7-2 record and a 2.09 earned run average in 64 games.“I never had to look down to the bullpen to see if Pedro was ready,” Willie Randolph, who managed the Mets from 2005 to 2008, said in a statement. “He was always on call and never said no. I know some days he was tired, but he always took the ball.”Feliciano left the Mets after going 3-6 with a 3.30 E.R.A. in 2010 and signed a two-year, $8 million contract with the Yankees. But he developed shoulder problems during spring training and was shut down for the season. He had rotator cuff surgery that September and missed the entire next major league season as well.The Yankees’ general manager, Brian Cashman, blamed the Mets for Feliciano’s injury, saying that they had “abused” him by asking him to pitch too many innings. Told of his comments, the Mets’ pitching coach, Dan Warthen, responded, “They didn’t know that when they signed him?”Feliciano, Warthen said, “volunteered for the baseball every day” and “wanted to pitch more than we even pitched him.”After returning to the Mets in 2013, Feliciano announced in spring training that doctors had found a small hole in the exterior of his heart. The diagnosis was left ventricular noncompaction, a condition caused by the failure of myocardial development from birth. When he began pitching in exhibition games that spring, he wore a heart monitor.He finished the 2013 season, his last in the majors, with a record of 0-2 and a 3.97 E.R.A. in 25 games.Pedro Juan Feliciano Molina was born on Aug. 25, 1976, in Rio Piedras, P.R. He was picked in the 31st round of the 1995 draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers and later pitched in the minor leagues for the Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds. The Reds traded him to the Mets in August 2002, and he made his major league debut the next month.Feliciano left the Mets to play in Japan in 2005 but rejoined the team the next season.Information on survivors was not immediately available."
57,"Amid Fear of a Work Stoppage, Baseball Is Stuck in Neutral","Baseball’s general managers have been meeting, just as they always do, but the potential of a lockout has a star-studded group of free agents waiting for the dust to settle.","Published Nov. 11, 2021","CARLSBAD, Calif. — Expected to still be rebuilding, this year’s Seattle Mariners offered a glimpse of their potential future. They won 90 games, the team’s highest total since 2003. Their hopes of reaching the postseason for the first time since 2001 — the longest playoff drought among teams from the four major North American men’s professional sports leagues — were alive until the final day of the regular season.So the mission for Jerry Dipoto, Seattle’s president of baseball operations, this off-season is clear: continue shaping the young team into a contender — with loosened purse strings from Mariners owners. For an aggressive and restless executive like Dipoto, though, this winter is likely to offer a unique challenge.At midnight on Dec. 1, the foundation of the sport — the collective bargaining agreement between the owners of the 30 Major League Baseball clubs and their players — expires. Both sides have publicly expressed some tepid optimism that a new deal will be reached by then. But given the many negotiating hurdles and fraught labor relations between M.L.B. and the players’ union, this hot stove season may be chillier and slower burning.Baseball has not had a work stoppage since the strike that prematurely ended the 1994 season, canceled that year’s World Series and bled into the next season. But if no agreement is reached in a few weeks, M.L.B.’s owners could enact a lockout to freeze transactions. If that were to happen, team executives wouldn’t be allowed to talk to players, make major-league signings or swing trades.“I can’t let those things affect me,” Dipoto said. “We are focused on how we make our team better and playing within the same parameters that we’ve always played in. All I can focus on is putting the team together. For us, that started a while ago. We’re engaged with free agents and we’re engaged in trade discussions. We’ll push and this is how we operate. We generally operate sooner rather than later. We tend to move pretty quickly and that part of our personality isn’t likely to change.”Dipoto’s comments were mirrored by many of his counterparts at M.L.B.’s annual general managers meetings this week at a Southern California hotel. In many ways, it had the trappings of a normal start to the off-season despite the elephant in the room (or lobby). Team executives gathered at the lavish Omni La Costa Resort and Spa for meetings with each other, M.L.B. officials and agents. Discussions about trades and free-agent signings were held in the courtyards, hotel suites and at the bar.Even Steven Matz — the free agent pitcher who had a resurgent season with the Toronto Blue Jays this year following an up-and-down tenure with the Mets — was spotted at the hotel.“You’re talking to a man who has been up until 3 o’clock in the morning every night I’ve been here,” said agent Scott Boras when asked about the possibility of a slower, interrupted off-season ahead. He doesn’t represent Matz but he has other top free-agent clients like pitcher Max Scherzer and infielders Corey Seager and Marcus Semien.Boras continued, “I would say that this marketplace is very aggressive because there are really good players out there.”Not a lot, though, typically happens this early in the off-season. Atlanta won the World Series on Nov. 2. In the weeks that follow, free-agent players are often fielding initial overtures from teams, which are conversely figuring out how much players are seeking in their contracts and future homes. Trade talks are happening simultaneously.“This is the feel-out period of time,” Derek Falvey, the chief baseball officer of the Minnesota Twins, said of this stage of the off-season. “For us, we’re talking with agents, we’re talking with other clubs, we’re talking about trades. We’ve had some conversations with players already and even made offers at different junctures. So for us, it doesn’t change.”Added John Mozeliak, the St. Louis Cardinals’ president of baseball operations: “These meetings so far have gone like the last 20 I’ve attended.”The biggest signing so far: The Los Angeles Dodgers inked the left-handed pitcher Andrew Heaney to a one-year, $8.5 million contract. But without much clarity on the future economic structure of the sport — the union has proposed, for example, ways for younger players to get paid more and sooner in their careers — mapping out budgets and building rosters might be more challenging. Pacts bigger and longer than Heaney’s might not be as common before a new labor deal is struck, which leaves players like Carlos Correa, the star shortstop of the Houston Astros, in limbo as he waits to sign what could be baseball’s next $300 million contract.“It’s no different than ’15, ’16,” said Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president of baseball operations, referring to the current collective bargaining agreement that was completed ahead of the previous pact’s Dec. 1, 2016 expiration.“Yeah, there are things that could change. And there are decisions we made before and decisions we made after they reached an agreement. You, at least, directionally have a sense of different things. You may not have all the details. But for the most part, it shouldn’t materially change any one decision. It may change a collection of decisions.”According to the payroll tracking site Cots Baseball Contracts, the Dodgers ($262 million) were believed to be the only team to exceed the current luxury tax threshold of $210 million in 2021. Five other teams — including the Yankees ($208 million), Houston Astros ($207 million) or San Diego Padres ($206 million) — were within $10 million of that line.In its August proposal to players, M.L.B. offered a hard salary floor of $100 million — which would be a first for the sport and is something the union has long opposed — in addition to a lower luxury tax threshold of $180 million with steeper rates for going over. (Draft-pick penalties would begin at $210 million.) So how do team executives plan for what could be moving goal posts?“I’ve had really no discussion with Hal on that because I don’t know what that is,” said Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman in reference to Hal Steinbrenner, the team’s managing general partner.“Nor would he or anybody else because they’re openly negotiating on that aspect,” Cashman continued. “So at the end of it all, we’ll operate under the current system knowing we have some latitude. And hopefully, obviously, regardless of what happens, the intent is to find a better team to enter spring training with than the one we ended the season with.”Cashman said he didn’t have a set budget from Steinbrenner but he had some direction on where payroll would go (up) given the Yankees’ needs (shortstop chief among them) and the money already committed to current players. As a result, the team will be connected to high-profile free agents like Correa and Seager.Sandy Alderson, the Mets’ president, said his team’s working assumption was that there will be no work stoppage starting on Dec. 2. Spring training is to begin in February, with the 2022 regular season scheduled to start on March 31. “We’re obviously mindful that things may come to a halt in early December or some time thereafter, but right now we’re building for the season and for the future,” he said.Perhaps, though, this normally slow start to the off-season could be a prime opening for a team to pounce given the potential pause ahead. Alderson said the Mets would be “opportunistic” but “we’ll see how players feel about the next three or four weeks, and whether there’s a mutual interest in doing something before Dec. 2.”"
58,N.F.L. Week 10 Predictions: Our Picks Against the Spread,"The gulf between the two conferences will show when Kansas City and the Las Vegas Raiders vie in the jammed A.F.C. West, and the Cleveland Browns try to derail the Patriots, while the Rams roll.","Published Nov. 11, 2021","Here’s our NFL Week 15 picks against the spread and predictionsThe midpoint of this elongated regular season is upon us, and the two conferences have charged ahead along divergent paths.In the N.F.C., just five teams — the Arizona Cardinals, Los Angeles Rams, Green Bay Packers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Dallas Cowboys — are legitimate Super Bowl contenders. There’s more parity in the A.F.C., where the 7-2 Titans have the best record, pacing nine other teams with respectable odds of playing in the N.F.L.’s final game of the season.That logjam should start to clear Sunday, when Las Vegas and Kansas City will try to gain ground in the A.F.C. West, where a mere half-game separates first place from last. The Cleveland Browns will be without running back Nick Chubb as they try to stop the streaking New England Patriots, who are creeping up on the Bills’ half-game lead in the A.F.C. East.Below is a look at N.F.L. Week 10, with all picks made against the spread.All times are Eastern.Byes: Bears, Bengals, Texans, GiantsLast week’s record: 5-9Kansas City at Las Vegas Raiders, 8:20 p.m., NBCLine: Kansas City -2.5 | Total: 52.5Kansas City (5-4) and Las Vegas (5-3) are both trying to keep pace in the A.F.C. West, where the Raiders and Chargers are tied for the division lead. Kansas City has the greater urgency here: A loss would drop its odds of reaching the postseason to 34 percent, according to The Times’ playoff predictor.It also has a harder road to getting that win. Kansas City is 1-4 against A.F.C. teams and its offense has been frustrated when defenses employ two high safeties, goading Patrick Mahomes into 10 interceptions so far. Against Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby, who is tied for second-most in quarterback hits (19), Kansas City should struggle to keep the score close. Pick Raiders +2.5Cleveland Browns at New England Patriots, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Patriots -1 | Total: 45.5The Patriots (5-4) are riding a three-game winning streak, sniffing at the A.F.C. East lead, and playing as consistently as it’s reasonable to expect from a team led by a rookie quarterback. Mac Jones has finished only two games with a completion percentage below 60 percent and New England has been able to lean on Damien Harris, who is tied for third in rushing touchdowns (7) and ranks ninth in yards (547).But Cleveland knows something about disruptions. The Browns (5-4) allow only 84.8 rushing yards per game, a factor that could unbalance the Patriots’ offense. Myles Garrett’s pressure could shorten the window for Jones’s throws downfield and Cleveland’s aggressive defense should carry the win, regardless of whether Browns running back Nick Chubb misses the game after a positive test for coronavirus. Pick: Browns +1.Minnesota Vikings at Los Angeles Chargers, 4:05 p.m., FoxLine: Chargers -2.5 | Total: 51.5Winning a close game against the Eagles last week does not hide the fact that the Chargers (5-3) still need to fix the worst rushing defense in the league. The Vikings (3-5) should feed Dalvin Cook, the league’s eighth-leading rusher (554 yards), and count on being able to keep the score close until Los Angeles proves its opponents need to add another dimension. Pick: Vikings +2.5Atlanta Falcons at Dallas Cowboys, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Cowboys -9 | Total: 52Maybe the Atlanta Sports Curse is subsiding. Its Major League Baseball team won the World Series, the Georgia Bulldogs are undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the College Football Playoff, and the Falcons (4-4) are surging, winners of three of their last four games.The Cowboys (6-2), though, can throw salt at all that Sunday. Coming off an embarrassing loss to the Broncos last week, Dallas will have something to prove. Dak Prescott should be better with another week to heal from his calf injury and if the other skill-position players remember how to catch a football, the Cowboys’ offense should succeed against an Atlanta defense that has allowed more than 30 points in three games this season. Pick: Cowboys -9New Orleans Saints at Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Titans -3 | Total: 45The Saints (5-3) are marching into Tennessee and bringing their inconsistencies with them. New Orleans has been the toughest team to predict all season, and after winning three straight games, they lost to the inferior Falcons last week.The Titans (7-2), meanwhile, have been steady, and continued their ascent last week, even without the workhorse running back Derrick Henry. Tennessee’s defense sacked Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford five times and so could rattle Saints backup Trevor Siemian. The Saints’ defense is strong, but the Titans should be able to take this one if they can score proficiently with their play-action. Pick: Titans -3Jacksonville Jaguars at Indianapolis Colts, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Colts -10.5 | Total: 47.5Flukes happen. That the Jaguars (2-6) beat the Bills in Week 9 does not change that Jacksonville is still perhaps one of the worst teams in the league. Repeating that four-sack performance against the Colts (4-5) probably won’t happen because Indianapolis will run often with Jonathan Taylor, who ranks second in the N.F.L. in rushing yards (821) and touchdowns (8). If the Colts lean on Taylor for offensive production and clock management, they will void the potential for turnovers and miscues that allowed Jacksonville to upset Buffalo. Pick: Colts -10.5Buffalo Bills at Jets, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Bills -13 | Total: 47.5The Bills (5-3) will be hungry and motivated after their embarrassing loss to the Jaguars, and their defense, which ranks first in fewest passing yards allowed (1,416), should be able to chomp on a Jets (2-6) team that will start an injured backup quarterback.Jets Coach Robert Saleh said Wednesday that Mike White will again start in place of Zach Wilson (knee). White has thrown for five touchdowns in seven quarters, but got a nerve contusion in his right forearm against the Colts last week. Buffalo should put up most of the points expected in this one. Pick: Bills -13Detroit Lions at Pittsburgh Steelers, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Steelers -9.5 | Total: 43.5Don’t bet on the Lions (0-8) to finally win their first game this week. The Steelers have allowed the second-fewest yards in the N.F.L. (2,420) and T.J. Watt, who has posted the second-most sacks this season (11.5) should be in contention for the Defensive Player of the Year Award. Detroit’s moral victories of playing competitively against good teams have not yet translated to actual wins, and until the Lions show they can both make good calls and execute them late in games, they will continue to justify the spread. Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is out, it was announced Saturday night, because he is on the Covid-19 protocol list. Pick: Steelers -9.5Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Washington Footballers, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Buccaneers -10 | Total: 51.5A rematch of last season’s N.F.C. wild-card matchup that Tampa Bay won 31-23 shouldn’t be as close this time around. The defense that carried the Footballers (2-6) to the playoffs in the 2020 season has allowed the sixth-most passing yards in the league. That benefits the Buccaneers (6-2) as Tom Brady ranks second in passing yards (2,650) and first in touchdowns (25), even with the playing statuses of receiver Antonio Brown (ankle) and tight end Rob Gronkowski (back) still unclear. Pick: Buccaneers -10Carolina Panthers at Arizona Cardinals, 4:05 p.m., FoxLine: Cardinals -10 | Total: 44.5The Sam Darnold experiment for the Panthers (4-5) is puttering out. Even before he fractured his shoulder last week against the Patriots, he was tied for first in the league in interceptions (11), and his three turnovers against New England caused Coach Matt Rhule to waffle on calling Darnold the starter moving forward.Now, with Darnold out likely for four to six weeks and newly reacquired Cam Newton a few weeks away from being ready, P.J. Walker will get the start against the Cardinals (8-1), whose offense played effectively even without Kyler Murray and DeAndre Hopkins last week. Murray will be a game-time decision, Hopkins is expected to miss this start, and the team lost running back Chase Edmonds for multiple weeks with a high ankle sprain. Still, that just means more touches for James Conner, who is tied for the N.F.L. lead in rushing touchdowns (10) and carried the offense against San Francisco in Week 9. Even if Murray doesn’t play, predict the Cardinals to cover with confidence. Pick: Cardinals -10Philadelphia Eagles at Denver Broncos, 4:25 p.m., CBSLine: Broncos -2.5 | Total: 45The Broncos (5-4) finally won a game against a strong opponent when the rookie running back Javonte Williams recorded the first 100-yard game of his career last week against the Cowboys. Denver can now pad its record with another win before getting to the heart of conference play. Williams could again go off against the Eagles (3-6), whose interior defense has allowed the seventh-most rushing yards (1,077) in the league. The Broncos should start a win streak. Pick: Broncos -2.5Seattle Seahawks at Green Bay Packers, 4:25 p.m., FoxLine: Packers -4 | Total: 49.5Russell Wilson returns for the Seahawks (3-5) after recovering from finger surgery and Aaron Rodgers was cleared to return after having tested positive for the coronavirus two weeks ago. Assuming Rodgers plays, the Packers (7-2) should slice through Seattle’s defense, which has given up the ninth-most yards in the league (3,212). Even if his backup, Jordan Love, commandeers Green Bay’s offense, a healthy dose of Aaron Jones and A.J. Dillon out of the backfield would be enough to cover the spread. Pick: Packers -4Los Angeles Rams at San Francisco 49ers, 8:15 p.m., ESPNLine: Rams -4 | Total: 49.5Los Angeles is clearly the better team, and San Francisco has been somewhat of a disappointment with continued injuries, as was the case last season. The 49ers (3-5) should make some tweaks to generate better matchups — tight end George Kittle will likely be used mostly as a blocker now that Von Miller is expected to make his Rams debut, and receiver Deebo Samuel may go one-on-one against Los Angeles cornerback Jalen Ramsey — but if the Rams (7-2) can continue to play with urgency, Samuel and Kittle won’t be enough for San Francisco to prevail. Odell Beckham Jr. is expected to play a limited role for Los Angeles, who lost receiver Robert Woods to an anterior cruciate ligament tear this week.Pick: Rams -4Dolphins 22, Ravens 10We picked the Ravens to win -7, thinking Lamar Jackson and Baltimore’s offense would have their way against the Dolphins’ defense, which has been one of the worst in the league all season.We picked wrong. In a game in which both offenses struggled in the first half, defense lifted Miami to a 22-10 win. The unit posted four sacks and one interception and returned a fumble for a touchdown. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who had been nursing a fractured finger, entered the game in the third quarter after Jacoby Brissett injured his knee and screamed in pain.Tagovailoa threw for 158 yards, including crucial completions of 35 yards and 64 yards that put the offense in scoring position. The Dolphins now have a two-game win streak. They will most likely still be considered betting underdogs for much of the season. But if the defense continues to play this well, it may become more difficult to decide whether Miami can cover the spread.A quick primer for those who are not familiar with betting lines: Favorites are listed next to a negative number that represents how many points they must win by to cover the spread. Raiders -5.5, for example, means that Las Vegas must beat Chicago by at least 6 points for its backers to win their bet. Gamblers can also bet on the total score, or whether the teams’ combined score in the game is over or under a preselected number of points."
59,"If You Can Make It There, the Mets Would Love to Have Your Number","As the team’s search for a general manager continues, Sandy Alderson said the pressure of New York City has been a factor. “It’s a big stage and some people prefer to be elsewhere.”","Nov. 9, 2021","CARLSBAD, Calif. — The Mets play in a vibrant city, in the largest market in Major League Baseball. They have passionate fans all over the region, country and world. Their stadium is only 12 years old. They have arguably the best pitcher in baseball in Jacob deGrom. And under their owner, Steven A. Cohen, the richest in baseball, the franchise has ample resources.So why are the Mets, for a second straight off-season, struggling to lure someone to lead their baseball operations department?“We’ve talked to a lot of people, probably half the people that are going to be here today,” Sandy Alderson, the president of the Mets, said on Tuesday morning with a chuckle while standing outside the hotel where M.L.B.’s general managers meetings were being held this week.“In some cases, we haven’t gotten permission,” he continued. “In some cases, I think people are comfortable where they are, whether it be a family situation or something. And in other cases, there’s a reluctance to come to New York. But I think it’s mostly about New York, not about Steve or the organization. It’s a big stage and some people prefer to be elsewhere.”Last winter, after Cohen bought the Mets and installed Alderson, the team’s former G.M., as its new president, the Mets wanted to hire both a president of baseball operations to work under Alderson and a general manager. But after striking out with several candidates, the Mets settled on hiring Jared Porter, from the Arizona Diamondbacks, as general manager and Zack Scott, from the Boston Red Sox, as an assistant general manager.After a month on the job, Porter was fired following allegations that he had sexually harassed a female reporter in a previous position. Scott became the acting general manager but was then placed on administrative leave in August following his arrest on a drunken-driving charge in White Plains, N.Y. He was fired earlier this month. (Scott has pleaded not guilty and his next hearing is scheduled for Dec. 8.)This winter, the Mets had hopes, again, of hiring a president of baseball operations, with such a position indicating the team’s desire to lure an experienced executive, rather than a first time head of baseball operations. But after casting a wide net for accomplished figures, like Billy Beane of the Oakland Athletics, the former Red Sox and Cubs executive Theo Epstein, and David Stearns of the Milwaukee Brewers, the Mets struck out — again.Alderson admitted on Tuesday that the team is now focused on hiring a G.M., which meant it was looking at a lower tier of experience levels. He didn’t rule out that the Mets may next year hire a president of baseball operations, which could make some candidates skittish.“There’s a certain amount of risk associated with it,” he said of the Mets’ general manager job. “And you can talk about the risk in terms of the organization. You can talk about the risk, I guess, in terms of me. You talk about the risk in terms of Steve. You can talk about the risk of New York. If you’re looking to be comfortable, the Mets are probably not the place to come. If you’re looking to be challenged and rewarded, because I don’t think there’s any doubt that this team is going to be successful over the next number of years, then go for it.”The Mets, though, have not been successful lately. They last reached the playoffs in 2016, went 77-85 in 2021 and last month parted ways with Manager Luis Rojas, the fourth person to hold the position in five years.On Tuesday, Alderson tried to dispel any concerns about the Mets’ general manager job. Regarding his own involvement in baseball operations, he said he would be an adviser. (He said he provided more oversight to Scott, for example, early on but less as the season progressed.) Regarding the presence of his son (Bryn was promoted to assistant general manager in July), he said there was a firewall between the two regarding the candidates.And given Alderson’s misfires in hiring Porter, Scott and former manager Mickey Callaway (who was fired by the Mets after two years and then later suspended by M.L.B. and fired by the Angels after a sexual harassment investigation), he was asked if he was the right person to be leading the hiring. He said yes. As he has in the past, he said the Mets should have vetted Callaway more beforehand and noted that they have expanded their vetting process.Because of the repeated failed bids to fill their top baseball opening, the Mets — a franchise frequently plagued by scandals, large and small, on and off the field — seemed like a punchline again. But Alderson insisted that the picture wasn’t so bleak. He said he wasn’t surprised it has been a challenge to find the right executive, but he did admit some surprise in terms of how many rejections they have received.“I’m not happy about the narrative,” he added later about the franchise. “On the other hand, looking at the organization from within, as opposed to without, I’m very pleased with where we’re going. The baseball operations department has been built out over the last year significantly. The same has been true on the business side. There’s a lot that’s very positive that’s going on. But what we have to do is make sure that that reality becomes perception. That’s a matter of putting your head down and keep moving forward.”Alderson said there are “several” general manager candidates under consideration and they would have a better idea by the end of the week after more interviews with him and Cohen. Once a general manager is in place, Alderson said the team would then hire a manager and fill out its coaching staff.Until then, Alderson said the Mets’ baseball affairs continued on under him. They offered $18.4 million qualifying offers to pitcher Noah Syndergaard and outfielder Michael Conforto on Saturday. He said the hot stove was typically slow in early November and noted that the only thing that could stop the baseball calendar was a lack of a new collective bargaining agreement between M.L.B. team owners and players. (The current deal expires on Dec. 1 and, if a new one is not struck in time, a lockout — a freeze on transactions — is expected.)“I’m confident that we’re going to find somebody that is very capable and is right for the job,” he said."
60,Canelo Álvarez Hopes to Unify the Belts at 168 Pounds,It’s difficult to be an undisputed champion in boxing. Álvarez feels he can burnish his legacy by taking all the major belts at 168 pounds.,"Published Nov. 5, 2021","LAS VEGAS — Saúl Álvarez and Caleb Plant punctuated their late-September news conference in Beverly Hills the way prizefighters often do — by squaring off for a stare-down, nose to nose, each promising to beat the other down when they finally met for the undisputed super-middleweight title. That bout is scheduled for Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.For Álvarez, the 168-pound champion in the World Boxing Association, World Boxing Council and World Boxing Organization, it was a routine performance. A 31-year-old from Guadalajara, Mexico, he knew the confrontation would help hype their bout but said he preferred not to invest energy in prefight photo ops.For Plant, the International Boxing Federation champion, the news conference stare-down was personal, as he says all of his bouts are. Álvarez, who goes by the nickname Canelo, isn’t just a competitor, but a rival.Yet as the boxers inched closer, their trash talk increasing in volume and venom, it was Álvarez, the veteran of 59 pro bouts, who professed not to like outside-the-ring skirmishes, who responded to an insult — he says Plant called him a vulgar name — with a two-handed shove. Plant bounced back and threw a left hand. Álvarez answered with a right and left, all the blows delivered and answered in a split second.Photos and video replays would show that the fighters had actually traded openhanded slaps. Plant’s fingertips grazed Álvarez’s cheek and temple. Álvarez connected with the ridge of his right palm and the heel of his left palm.Even now, just before their bout, it’s still unclear how, exactly, a single swear word triggered the scuffle. Álvarez said he thought that Plant intended the gravest insult possible.“It got out of control. I’ve never been involved in anything like that. The truth is, I don’t like it at all. I’m going to take it out on him in the ring,” Álvarez said.Plant, for his part, said both fighters used the word. It’s audible in video of the skirmish featured in Showtime’s prefight documentary series. The voice sounds like Álvarez’s.“It was just normal prefight banter,” Plant, who is 21-0 with 12 knockouts, said in an interview. He added: “That’s the fight game, and if people don’t like it, they can watch Little League Baseball.”A news conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday unfolded with no such drama. Álvarez and Plant posed for photos separately, then left the stage without the customary face-off.While it’s still unclear which of the two fighters incited the skirmish in September, the stakes for Saturday’s fight are unambiguous. Álvarez holds three world championships at 168 pounds. Plant holds one. The winner will emerge as the division’s undisputed champion.“It’s really important for me because few fighters in history have done it. None in Latin America,” Álvarez, whose only loss was to Floyd Mayweather in 2013, said. “This is the most important fight of my career.”Professional boxing has 17 weight classes but features only one reigning undisputed champion: Josh Taylor of Scotland, at 140 pounds.Holding four titles simultaneously requires aligning all four major sanctioning bodies’ priorities, a nearly impossible act. After defeating Deontay Wilder last month, the W.B.C. heavyweight champion Tyson Fury made clear his desire to unify the heavyweight title in 2022 against the winner of a springtime rematch between Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk. But the W.B.C. wants Fury to defend his belt against the English heavyweight Dillian Whyte and could strip him of the title if he chooses otherwise.Factor in the sport’s competing promoters and broadcast platforms, who typically cooperate as willingly as Democrats and Republicans in Congress, and the goal of a unified title becomes even more elusive. Bipartisan bouts happen if the stakes are high enough. Top Rank worked with Premier Boxing Champions on the two most recent Fury-Wilder fights, and the rival outfits will partner again when the welterweight champion Terence Crawford fights Shawn Porter on Nov. 20.In this environment, Álvarez, a promotional and broadcast free agent, operates like an independent, making the fights he wants, on all sides of boxing’s promotional divides, for the money he commands. For Saturday’s bout, which will air on Showtime pay-per-view, Álvarez will gross a reported $40 million, while Plant is guaranteed $10 million.“That’s understandable, given that Álvarez wants the biggest, legacy-defining fights available at this point in his career,” Stephen Espinoza, the president of Showtime Sports, said. “This is a legacy-defining fight for a fighter who already has a hall-of-fame résumé. Or it could be the elevation of Caleb Plant to an entirely new level of stardom.”Álvarez, who has held world titles in four weight classes, will enter Saturday’s bout as the betting favorite and the A-side fighter. He’s a veteran whose tactics shift as opponents and situations dictate — a boxer-puncher in his 2013 win over Austin Trout, and a come-forward slugger in recent wins over Billy Joe Saunders and Callum Smith.“I want to make history. That’s what motivates me,” Álvarez, who is 56-1-2, said. “I’m still improving, every day.”Plant is a technical, tactical boxer who recognizes that a series of challengers, like Saunders and Smith, have tried and failed to beat Álvarez with skill and strategy. Their plans unraveled in the middle rounds, when Álvarez began landing heavy punches.But Plant, a 29-year-old from Ashland City, Tenn., promises a different outcome. He has spent his whole career as a super-middleweight, and he will enter the ring with advantages in size and reach.“There’s been a handful of guys who have had a good amount of success against Canelo,” Plant, a national Golden Gloves champion in 2011, said. “I’m a full-fledged super-middleweight. I possess a lot of the same skills and ring I.Q. that those guys do, but I’m 6-1 and a half.”"
61,Three Big Questions Heading Into Free Agency,Is Carlos Correa the next $300 million player? Would Freddie Freeman leave Atlanta? Can Toronto keep its bargain-bin finds? We may be waiting a long time to find out.,"Published Nov. 5, 2021","With the completion of the World Series, baseball moved immediately into free agency — sort of. The league’s collective bargaining agreement is set to expire on Dec. 1, and as a result, very little movement is expected as teams and players alike wait to find out how everything is going to shake out. The possibility exists that the league could enact a lockout on Dec. 2, which would halt all activities until a deal is reached.As we wait for those proceedings to finalize, and hope the sport does not find itself in a work stoppage, there are some big questions to ponder while the hot stove preheats.The cost of a top-flight shortstop is high — very high. After Fernando Tatis Jr. signed a market-altering $340 million contract with the San Diego Padres ahead of the 2021 season, Francisco Lindor went a million better by getting $341 million from the Mets. Correa is younger (and, arguably, better) than Lindor and is light years beyond Tatis in defense and durability. So, $350 million? $400 million?Now factor in the stain of 2017. Correa was a central figure in the Astros’ sign-stealing scandal and has embraced his role as an unapologetic spokesman for that tainted core to the point where he can sometimes feel like a wrestling heel.The reality is that the No. 1 overall pick of the 2012 draft just turned 27, is coming off his best all-around season, has excelled in the postseason and is viewed by his teammates as the ultimate leader.“Hopefully Carlos re-signs here to stay together,” Yuli Gurriel said ahead of the American League Championship Series. “But it’s always hard, and this is a business, and we have to understand that. The last few years, he’s assumed that role of leadership and he’s done it well.”Houston, which has never given a player a contract larger than $151 million and let George Springer, another homegrown superstar, walk away last off-season, is unlikely to approach Lindor/Tatis territory to retain Correa — though the team did extend him a qualifying offer, which means any other team that signs him will have to provide draft pick compensation. And his polarizing nature outside of Houston and the fact that the list of available free agents includes other star shortstops like Corey Seager of the Dodgers and Trevor Story of the Rockies could tamp down his demands to a certain extent. But anything less than $300 million in total value on a contract of 10-12 years would be an absolute bargain for the team that signs Correa — which is quite a circumstance.Both sides have been saying all the right things. Freeman wants to stay in Atlanta — the soft-service ice cream machine helps — and the Braves want him to stay. But the financial realities of the game exist even after a World Series win and, let’s not forget, even Henry Aaron finished his career with the Milwaukee Brewers.“I think everyone in this room knows I want to stay here,” Freeman said in a news conference during the World Series.Freeman, 32, might be even more accomplished than you realize. Since 2013, his on-base plus slugging percentage, when adjusted for league and home ballpark, has been at least 30 percent above average in each season. He has already accomplished that feat in a qualifying season as many times as Hall of Famers like Hank Greenberg, Carl Yastrzemski and Willie McCovey did in their entire careers. He has 271 home runs, won the 2020 N.L. Most Valuable Player Award, is a five-time All-Star, a Gold Glove-winner and was the best active player for a World Series-winning team.He also just finished an eight-year $135 million contract — the largest contract in franchise history — and probably wants a raise from the $22 million he made in 2021. For now the team has extended a qualifying offer to him, which is largely a formality.Atlanta bought itself some financial flexibility by signing young stars like Ronald Acuña Jr. and Ozzie Albies to long-term deals that are well below their market value but postseason heroes Eddie Rosario and Jorge Soler are eligible for free agency and Game 6-winner Max Fried is eligible for salary arbitration. Some compromises will have to be made and Freeman could probably make more money elsewhere if that is what he chooses to prioritize.Toronto has to be wondering what might have been if only the Blue Jays had made the playoffs. The team was forced to play its home games for the first half of the season in Florida and Buffalo, which probably contributed to an uneven start. The hole proved too deep to climb out of to make the playoffs even though the team’s run differential of plus-183 was better than all but four teams in the majors.The core of the team is a truly electrifying group of young stars like Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette and Teoscar Hernandez, and Toronto hasn’t shied away from spending big in free agency, tossing $150 million at George Springer and $80 million at Hyun-jin Ryu to complement that young core.But with all that, the team’s best pitcher in 2021 was Robbie Ray, a Cy Young Award hopeful who was acquired essentially for nothing (the player Toronto sent to Arizona for him in 2020 was brought back to the Blue Jays for cash six months later). And the team’s most valuable position player, in terms of wins above replacement, wasn’t Guerrero, who flirted with winning the triple-crown, but was instead Marcus Semien, a second baseman who was signed to a shocking-in-retrospect one-year, $18 million deal after Oakland chose not to retain him.Ray and Semien, who were both given qualifying offers for 2022, cost a combined $26 million in 2021 and produced 13.9 WAR. It would be reasonable for them each to want nearly that much per season going forward, and with the Blue Jays knowing they will have to pay players like Guerrero and Bichette market value in the coming years, adding on large commitments for a 30-year-old pitcher and a 31-year-old infielder might be pushing the team past a payroll threshold that it can manage.How many years can a team reasonably commit to a 37-year-old Max Scherzer being a top-of-the-rotation ace? Does that math change when you consider the other frontline starters available, besides Scherzer and Ray, are a fairly underwhelming group headlined by Kevin Gausman, the oft-injured Noah Syndergaard and the recovering-from-surgery Justin Verlander? (Marcus Stroman of the Mets and Carlos Rodon of the White Sox might really cash in when considering the fragility and age of the other options.)How much is a 33-year-old Starling Marte worth after hitting .310 and leading the majors in stolen bases? Will Nelson Cruz, 41, ever show an appreciable decline? What will become of the Cubs’ championship core that scattered to the wind at the trading deadline? Will Trevor Bauer ever pitch again (for the Dodgers or otherwise)? And will the Mets, who have been linked to roughly every baseball operations person in baseball, only to have that interest quickly rejected, get a new general manager in place before players start signing with other teams?"
62,"Citing the Pain of a Demanding Job, Buster Posey Retires at 34","Posey, the Giants’ catcher and three-time World Series champion, said going out on his own terms was a factor in his decision.","Published Nov. 4, 2021","Moments after Buster Posey, the star catcher who guided the San Francisco Giants through the team’s greatest era with three World Series titles, surprisingly announced his retirement on Thursday, one of his former bosses wanted to be sure.“Is this a definite, like for sure thing?” Farhan Zaidi, the Giants’ president of baseball operations, said while seated near Posey during a news conference at Oracle Park, the team’s stadium. “I just had to ask.”Posey was indeed serious — even after enjoying one of the best seasons of his career and leading the Giants to a franchise-record 107 wins and a National League West division title during the regular season. Despite those achievements, Posey, 34, felt it was time to walk away from playing.“I want to be able to do more stuff from February to November with my family,” he said. “Physically it’s much harder now. And to be honest, it’s hard to enjoy it as much when there’s the physical pain that you’re dealing with on a daily basis.“I halfway joke with our training staff about being done five years ago. But I don’t know how far of a stretch that’s really off without the work they were doing daily, with a history of an ankle injury and then a hip. It was just getting to the point where things that I was enjoying were not as joyful anymore.”Playing 12 years in the major leagues takes its toll on the body, but no position is more demanding than catcher. Still, despite the wear and tear and injuries, Posey became one of the most accomplished players of his generation.The Giants selected Posey, a Georgia native, out of Florida State University with the fifth overall pick in 2008, and he produced a splendid résumé that may one day land him in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.Posey won the 2010 N.L. Rookie of the Year Award and the 2012 N.L. Most Valuable Player Award in a career in which he won a batting title, was named to seven All-Star teams, received four Silver Slugger awards and won one Gold Glove Award. And, of course, he won World Series titles in 2010, ’12 and ’14. Since the start of the 2010 season, only Mike Trout, the Angels’ three-time winner of the A.L. M.V.P., has recorded more wins above replacement (77.8) than Posey (57.8), according to FanGraphs.“He not only excelled on the field, but he was a quiet leader that led by example,” said Giants Chairman Greg Johnson, who noted that he cried after Posey called last week to give him the news. “He has been the consummate professional, both on and off the field.”The M.V.P., batting title and World Series championship in 2012 may be his most impressive achievements on the field and they came shortly after his career was nearly derailed. During a game in May 2011, Posey was injured in a collision at the plate with the Florida Marlins’ Scott Cousins. A lower leg bone was broken and three ligaments in his ankle were torn. Screws were inserted during surgery. Many worried if he would ever be the same. (The incident eventually led to new rules to protect catchers from such collisions.)After an excruciating rehabilitation, Posey returned in 2012 to hit .336 with 24 home runs and 103 runs batted in over 148 games and win his second ring. Six years later, he also underwent surgery for a hip injury.At his news conference on Thursday, Posey declined to detail how much his body had hurt in recent years because he said he didn’t want to make excuses for any down performances. He said going out on his own terms was a factor in his decision, given that so many star players see a steep decline or eventually get pushed out.Being around his family more was a bigger reason to retire. Posey forfeited his salary and opted out of the 2020 coronavirus-shortened season to be at home after he and his wife, Kristen, adopted twins, who were hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit after birth.Posey said he returned this season because he wanted to prove that he could still play at a high level after having the worst season of his career in 2019 and missing 2020. Rested throughout the season, he produced the second highest on-base plus slugging percentage (.889) of his career and led the surprising Giants in upsetting the defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers, who had won eight consecutive division titles, for the N.L. West crown. (They fell to the 106-win Dodgers in a division series in the playoffs.)Entering 2021, the final guaranteed season of his nine-year $167 million extension, Posey said he had a feeling it would be his last. And as the season went on, he never wavered. Even after playing well, he wasn’t swayed.“That’s part of the reason I do feel at peace with my decision, because it would obviously be much harder if I felt otherwise,” said Posey, whose contract had a $22 million club option for 2022.Posey said he would miss the camaraderie of and competing alongside his teammates and team officials, and seeing fans everyday. But he said he expected to remain involved with the Giants somehow. Johnson said the team was still ironing out a future role for Posey off the field."
63,A Game 6 Redemption That Was 10 Years in the Making,"Ron Washington finally got what had seemed inevitable in 2011: a championship. That he did it as a coach, rather than a manager, is OK with him. “I’m a world champion.”","Nov. 4, 2021","HOUSTON — Ron Washington has worked in professional baseball for over 50 years, since he signed with the Kansas City Royals as a prospect at 18. But for all his time playing, coaching, managing and coaching again, and for the thousands of games he has been a part of, a pair of Game 6s 10 years apart are now the landmarks of his post-playing career.One of them was a crushing loss in which a single strike on two separate occasions would have made him a champion. The other was a sweet victory on Tuesday that finally made it happen.Washington stood on the field late Tuesday night at Minute Maid Park after Atlanta beat the Houston Astros, 7-0, in Game 6 of the World Series to clinch the franchise’s second championship in Atlanta, and first with Washington as its third-base and infield coach.He wore a World Series champions T-shirt, held a victory cigar in one hand and imagined the jewelry that would soon adorn the other.“I’ve got two rings at home that say American League champions,” Washington said. “Now I’m going to have one that says world champion. All the years I put into this game, I finally got one.”Washington managed the Texas Rangers from 2007 through 2014, and led them to two American League pennants. But Texas lost the 2010 World Series to the San Francisco Giants, and the 2011 Series to the St. Louis Cardinals.The second one has haunted the Rangers franchise because of what happened in Game 6.The Rangers led by two runs with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning in St. Louis, but with two strikes and two runners on base, David Freese of the Cardinals hit a long, but catchable, ball over the head of Texas right fielder Nelson Cruz, who was not playing deep enough. Cruz misjudged the ball’s flight, and it hit the wall for a triple. The game was tied and headed for extra innings.The Rangers went ahead again in the top of the 10th on a two-run home run by Josh Hamilton, and for the second time in two innings the Rangers were one strike away from champagne. But the Cardinals fought back once again, and Lance Berkman singled home the second run to tie it again. Freese homered in the 11th to win the game, and the Cardinals won Game 7, too.There was no such drama on Tuesday, as the script’s sad ending was reversed for Washington. This time, he stood down the third-base line to congratulate Atlanta’s three home run hitters — Jorge Soler, Dansby Swanson and Freddie Freeman — with low fives as they made the turn and headed home. Much of the game was never even close, and after what he went through in Game 6 in St. Louis 10 years earlier, that suited Washington just fine.“This is very special for all of us,” Washington said. “But, yes, especially for me, too, because we did come so close in 2011. I’m a world champion now, and it doesn’t matter if I did it as a coach or a manager. I’m a world champion.”Washington, 69, said he planned to return to Atlanta with the team and revel in the victory celebrations and parade. He could also become a candidate for open managerial jobs. Currently, there are vacancies with the Mets and the Oakland Athletics, where Washington coached from 1996 to 2006. That was before he took over as the Rangers manager, and he went back to Oakland to coach again in 2015 and 2016, before he went to Atlanta.Washington reached an unceremonious end to his time in Texas. The team had looked past revelations of a positive drug test for cocaine that were made public in 2010, only to have Washington resign with little explanation in 2014 — Washington eventually acknowledged that he had stepped away because he had an extramarital affair and needed to focus on his family.But he has always engendered devotion from players for his seemingly endless supply of passion and enthusiasm for his craft, and his ability to make them laugh and enjoy their work.He is considered one of the best infield coaches in the game, so much so that Eric Chavez, Oakland’s six-time Gold Glove-winning third baseman, gave Washington his 2004 award, adorned with the inscription, “Wash, not without you.”Alex Anthopoulos, Atlanta’s general manager, said that Washington’s insight is held in the highest regard within the organization. No defensive tactical decisions are made or even considered without Washington’s input and ultimate approval, he said.“He has meant everything,” Anthopoulos said in a text message on Wednesday. “His passion, love and preparation are second to none. He always believed, and deserves this as much as anyone in the organization.”Atlanta has won the National League East in four of the five years of Washington’s tenure with the team, but it failed to make it to the World Series until this year. But once it did, Washington felt certain the team would go on to win it all.He pointed to the work the talented players put in and added that they, along with Anthopoulos, Manager Brian Snitker and the rest of the coaching staff, all did their part to make the operation sizzle throughout October — particularly in a World Series Game 6 that Washington can now smile about, 10 years later.“I’m overwhelmed right now,” he said. “I’m so happy, I can’t even show how happy. That’s how happy I am.”"
64,The Thing Everyone Wants but No One Actually Wears,"World Series rings are the ultimate goal for many in baseball, but for those who win them practicality can get in the way.","Nov. 3, 2021","HOUSTON — Someday you may find yourself in a restaurant, an airport or a store with a member of the 2021 Atlanta Braves. You might remember him from that joyous throng bouncing around on the grass at Minute Maid Park in Houston after winning the World Series. And if you shake his hand, you might notice something missing.The championship ring. Everybody wants it, but good luck finding someone who wears it.“I haven’t worn it or looked at it since we got it,” said Alex Bregman, the third baseman for the Houston Astros, whose season ended with a 7-0 loss in Game 6 on Tuesday. “I’ve been focused on the next one.”His ring, from 2017, is something like the sun: Bregman can always bask in its glow, but it’s very bright and he cannot look at it. The ring has 112 diamonds on top, one for each of the Astros’ victories in the regular season and playoffs that year. It also has an inscribed slogan, “Earned History,” which took on a bitter irony after revelations of the Astros’ electronic sign-stealing scheme from that season.In Houston, at least, fans still revere the ring. A giant replica sits on the sidewalk outside the park, on Texas Street, beside bricks honoring the former president George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, who were dedicated Astros fans. In some ways, World Series rings are largely about connecting with fans, those loyal but unlucky folks who never get to win them.“Some of these guys would wear it quite often, but I feel like I’m showing off,” said Rod Gaspar, a spare outfielder on the 1969 Mets, at a team reunion two years ago. “But a guy I’ve done business with over the years, he said, ‘Rodney, you need to wear the ring, not for you but for other people, because they’ve never seen a World Series ring.’ Very few have seen one.”Steve Blass, who won the clincher for the 1971 Pittsburgh Pirates, went on to have a long career in the team’s broadcast booth. He wore the ring to work, he said, and delighted in showing it to fans he met at the ballpark. It also came in handy in another job, for Josten’s, the ring company, after his pitching career ended unexpectedly because of wildness in 1974.“The fact that I could wear one helped me out, although the kids were wondering, ‘What’s this World Series hero doing selling high school class rings?’” Blass said. “I got a lot of funny looks. But Jostens liked to hire ex-professional athletes because they knew what it’s like to get their butt kicked and get up out of bed and get in the car and go out and work. You know winning and losing, so you’re not devastated when you don’t get a sale.”In the mid-1970s, Blass was not selling the kinds of rings teams distribute today. The Los Angeles Dodgers’ 11-carat rings from 2020 — 222 round diamonds, 10 princess-cut diamonds, 45 custom-cut genuine sapphires and 8 round genuine sapphires — came in a box with an interior LCD screen that plays a four-minute highlight video, with sound, when opened.And that ring is not even considered the gaudiest. Jeffrey Loria, an art dealer who owned the Marlins in 2003, commissioned a championship ring with 228 diamond chips and 13 rubies, part of a massive showpiece with the team name displayed across a twisting fish, with a teal diamond as its eye.“It was a lot bigger than we expected,” said Rick Helling, a pitcher for that team who now works for the players’ association. “It was so big they actually made a smaller one that you could purchase to wear. What happened was, the owner was talking like, ‘Hey, if we win this thing, we’re going to have the best ring ever.’ So a lot of the players, like Josh Beckett and Dontrelle Willis, were like, ‘All right — you said it!’ And give him credit, he actually came through. It’s an amazing ring. When people see it, they’re like, ‘Wow!’”Helling does not wear that ring, though, nor does he wear the much smaller ring he got for playing with the Marlins’ other title team, in 1997, even though he was traded to the Rangers that summer. It is customary, but not mandatory, to give rings to all players who appeared for a team in a championship season, though it wasn’t always that way.Team owners can always right old wrongs. Peter O’Malley, who succeeded his father, Walter, as the Dodgers’ owner for many years, surprised a former pitcher, Joe Black, with an overdue memento from the team’s 1955 title in Brooklyn.“Joe had been traded during the ’55 season,” said Leonard Coleman, the former National League president and a close friend of Black, who died in 2002. “One time in Vero Beach he said something to O’Malley like, ‘I didn’t even get a championship ring,’ nothing more than that. But a couple months later, I got a phone call from Joe: ‘You’re not going to believe this, but guess what Peter just sent me? He had a ’55 championship ring made for me!’ Now if you play for the team for a month, you get a ring and the whole works. But back then, they didn’t do it.”Sal Fasano, an Atlanta coach, took one at-bat for the 2002 Angels and got a ring. He said on Tuesday in Houston that it symbolized everything he learned that season, and the winning example the Angels ingrained in him.“But a ring here would mean probably 100 times more,” he said.Fasano vowed to actually wear the Braves’ ring — though, of course, he will not know just how big it will be until the ceremony next spring. When he sees it, Fasano may find himself like A.J. Hinch, the manager of the 2017 Astros, who has used his ring as a ball marker to needle his buddies on the golf course but rarely wears it out.“I mean, it’s enormous,” said Hinch, who now manages the Detroit Tigers. “And the second part of it is, in the terms of today’s kids, it’s like the biggest flex of all time. You almost feel uncomfortable showing off with it.”Even Mr. October himself, the five-time champion Reggie Jackson, does not wear his World Series rings. On the field before Game 6 on Tuesday, his fingers were bare — “I’m a watch guy,” Jackson explained — but if he did wear a ring, it would probably be the one he got for being inducted to the Hall of Fame. That ring is more understated, with a simple baseball atop a black backdrop on its face.“The Hall of Fame is more exclusive,” said Jackson, now an adviser to Astros owner Jim Crane. “Everybody gets a World Series ring. George was the guy that got generous.”Yet even George Steinbrenner, the longtime Yankees owner who loved lavish gestures, probably did not spring for 1,332 rings, the total that Crane distributed in 2017 to Astros players, staff, front office members, trainers, clubhouse attendants, broadcasters and so on.The Braves were similarly generous in 1995, awarding rings to minor league staffers like Brian Snitker, who is now their manager. Snitker keeps it in a lockbox.“The things are not real comfortable to wear, if you want to know the truth,” he said.That Braves ring — engraved, perhaps prematurely, with the slogan “Team of the 90s” — is the last one without a team logo on top, though naturally there are dozens of diamonds. Even so, John Schuerholz, the architect of the 1995 champions, did not wear it in Atlanta during this World Series.Schuerholz, the former Braves general manager, wore his Hall of Fame ring instead. As important as it is to win a World Series ring, he once explained, it is not really baseball’s ultimate prize.“I sat next to Bob Gibson the year after I was inducted, and I had a championship ring on; I didn’t have my Hall of Fame ring,” Schuerholz said. “I sit down and he says, ‘Where’s your Hall of Fame ring?’ I said, ‘Well, I didn’t know if it was appropriate to wear.’ He said, ‘Let me just say one thing: everybody in this picture today has lots of rings. No one will you ever see wearing a ring other than this one, because there’s no greater honor — for individuals, or for the team you represent or the organization you helped build.’ I said, ‘OK, Bob, I got that.’“That intensity from Bob Gibson, that resonated with me. I wear this every day.”"
65,Atlanta Had to Celebrate Its Title Without Its Architect,"Home after testing positive for the coronavirus, Alex Anthopoulos missed the party that wouldn’t have been possible without his brilliant deadline maneuvers.","Nov. 3, 2021","HOUSTON — The coronavirus test came back positive Saturday morning. The man who crushed the trade deadline by bringing in four outfielders who would carry his team through the World Series was now crushed himself.Alex Anthopoulos, Atlanta’s president of baseball operations and general manager, architect of one of the greatest trade deadlines in memory, a man who not long ago left a five-year contract extension and millions on the table in Toronto as a matter of principle, now would have to stay home and miss Games 4 and 5 in Atlanta and, ultimately, Game 6 here Tuesday night as his team clinched its first championship since 1995.“I’m fully vaxxed, I don’t have any symptoms, I feel great,” Anthopoulos said by phone from his home in the Atlanta area around 2 a.m. Eastern time Wednesday as Atlanta’s celebration roared on without him at Minute Maid Park. “I was surprised. My family is fine.”He added: “We watched the game together at home like it was a New Year’s Eve party at my house counting down the outs at home. I’d love to be there.”Only Terry McGuirk, the club’s chairman, and Manager Brian Snitker knew about the positive test, Anthopoulos said, because “what I didn’t want was for it to become a story where the players and manager were getting asked about it. I wanted all the focus on the team.”The players didn’t even know until after they won the title, Anthopoulos said, because “one minute of time spent with me being the topic would have been inappropriate.” It turned out he wasn’t alone: Kevin Liles, a photographer for the team, revealed a positive test Wednesday as well.Everyone in and out of an Atlanta uniform playing for the team, working for the organization or simply lucky enough on this night to be somehow related to all this fun, agreed: Life and baseball both sometimes are not fair, but it is how you play the hops that counts.Anthopoulos played them beautifully. This was a team that didn’t quite take off until the season’s second half. The starting pitcher Mike Soroka (Achilles’ tendon) and outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. (knee) were lost early in the season to devastating injuries. Another outfielder, Marcell Ozuna, did not play after June 1 after he was arrested on domestic violence charges.The story already has been told countless times and will be told by Atlanta baseball fans for generations to come. Rather than feel sorry for themselves and wave the white flag, Anthopoulos and his front office acquired four outfielders at the trade deadline: Joc Pederson from the Chicago Cubs, Eddie Rosario from Cleveland, Adam Duvall from Miami and Jorge Soler from Kansas City.Duvall and Soler combined to knock in 12 of Atlanta’s 25 runs in this World Series. Rosario, who was the most valuable player of the National League Championship Series, scored five of them. Soler was named the most valuable player of the World Series. Never before have two midseason acquisitions cornered both postseason M.V.P. awards for a team.“He’s here, he really is,” McGuirk said of Anthopoulos while celebrating on the field. “We’ve lived dog years through this year. We were left for dead multiple times in the first half.”Back home in Georgia, Anthopoulos’s family was back in bed. Alex watched the game with his wife, Cristina, and, partly, with his daughter, Julia, 11, and son, John, 9. The kids went to bed at 8:30 p.m., but Alex woke Julia when Soler smashed a three-run homer in the third inning. Then he woke John in the ninth inning “so he could watch the end.”“I wouldn’t trade Alex Anthopoulos for any executive in baseball,” McGuirk said. “I fell in love with him the first time I met him, and he’s more than rewarded the faith we had in him. I just FaceTimed him a few minutes ago and he’s as ecstatic as all of us.”Anthopoulos’s path to the World Series came after a near miss in 2015 and then a bombshell. A native of Montreal, he started in baseball with the Expos in 2000, moved to the Blue Jays in 2003 and ascended to vice president of baseball operations and general manager there in 2009. By 2015 he had built a 93-game winner that nearly pushed Kansas City, the eventual World Series champion, to a Game 7 in the A.L.C.S., leaving runners on second and third in the ninth inning of a 3-2 loss in Game 6. It was Toronto’s first playoff appearance in 22 years.Less than a week later, he was gone. The team had hired Mark Shapiro from Cleveland to replace Paul Beeston as president and, unlike Beeston, Shapiro’s style was to involve himself in baseball operations. Anthopoulos, the newly minted A.L. Executive of the Year, declined the five-year extension that he termed a “beyond generous offer” and bet on himself.“Trust me, I was 38, I remember walking out of that meeting with that offer thinking, ‘OK, I think I’m going to stay,’” Anthopoulos said. “But the more I thought about it, I just couldn’t get comfortable. I wanted to get comfortable, I really did. But I couldn’t. And it wouldn’t have been fair to the organization and to everyone there for me not to be all in. And if I was not all in, I wasn’t going to sign.”He and Cristina talked that night.“Her family was there, our kids were in school, we were settled and she said, ‘What do you think?’” Anthopoulos said. “I said, ‘I want to take it. It’s unbelievable for my family. But I don’t believe I’m going to be happy. But if you want me to sign it, I’ll sign it.’ She said: ‘If you’re not happy, you’re not going to be a good dad and you’re not going to be a good husband. You’re 38. Let’s not worry about the money.’”So they slept on it. Anthopoulos asked Cristina the next morning if she was sure she was OK with the decision. And with that he left the Blue Jays.Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers’ chief baseball executive, quickly added Anthopoulos to a powerhouse staff that included Farhan Zaidi, now San Francisco’s president of baseball operations. Two years later, when M.L.B. issued a lifetime ban to Atlanta’s general manager, John Coppolella, for violating international signing rules, the club brought Anthopoulos east.He inherited a team that included several key components of this year’s run, including Freddie Freeman, Dansby Swanson, Ozzie Albies and Acuña. He added several of his own touches, like naming Snitker as manager and this year’s trade deadline flourishes.“Personally, it is impossible to be any happier for Alex, Cristina and their kids,” Friedman said in a text message shortly after Atlanta won Tuesday night. “He is as committed, passionate and knowledgeable of an executive as I have been around. He and his staff have done an incredible job adjusting to all of the challenges they were confronted with this season.”John Schuerholz, the Hall of Fame executive who was Atlanta’s general manager from 1990-2007 and remains vice chairman emeritus, called Anthopoulos the “perfect fit.”“He’s smart. He cares about people. He knows how to interact with people,” Schuerholz said. “He plans ahead. He’s always got good plans and he activates them when it’s appropriate.”At home in the wee hours, Anthopoulos paused to take inventory. Toronto is in a “great position” right now, he said. He had two good years with Friedman and Zaidi out west and, now, this. He is the first Canadian-born general manager to win a World Series title, and while he said that everything happens for a reason, he acknowledged “this isn’t the way I thought it would work out.”The first World Series game Anthopoulos attended was in Toronto, Game 5, 1992, when Atlanta’s Lonnie Smith hit a grand slam. His uncle was a Toronto season-ticket holder and his friend had seats. And Anthopoulos watched Atlanta regularly in Montreal because his family had TBS, the cable network that carried Braves games for more than 30 years.“It’s incredible,” Anthopoulos said. “You never know where your path is going to bring you. As long as you make decisions in life for the right reasons, in the long run things should work out.”He paused, then added: “Obviously, I would have loved to be there. ‘Elated’ is probably an understatement, but I view this as not a one-night thing. It is something you celebrate forever.”"
66,How Atlanta Retooled Its Team on the Fly,,,
67,The Heart and Soul of a Franchise Shines Through,"Freddie Freeman might have played his final game for Atlanta on Tuesday. Even if he did, he has already delivered on a promise he made to honor his mother.","Published Nov. 3, 2021","HOUSTON — The friendliest man in baseball is a champion. Freddie Freeman, the Atlanta Braves’ slugger known for smiles, small talk and soft-serve ice cream, hit the last home run of the season and caught the throw from shortstop for the final out of the World Series. Nice guys finish first.This is the life Freeman wanted — the baseball career, yes, but also the reputation he has earned along the way. He owed that much to his mother, Rosemary, who died of melanoma in 2000.“He felt like, to honor his mom, he had to be a great kid,” his father, Fred Freeman, said on the Minute Maid Park infield late Tuesday night, after Atlanta finished off the Houston Astros, 7-0, in Game 6. “That was it. When he was 10, that’s what he decided he was going to be. He always said, ‘I know mom’s watching.’”The roof was open on a warm night here Tuesday, perfect viewing for Hank Aaron, Phil Niekro, Rosemary Freeman and so many more. Maybe you believe in that imagery, maybe you don’t. But the soul of the Braves does, and for now, he is the one atop the baseball world.“Believe me, I wish I was able to hug my mom on that field,” Freeman said. “But I know she’s up with my grandma right now, jumping up and down.”Freeman said his wife, Chelsea, texted him two hours before Game 6 to tell him his mother would be proud of him. It was not a message Freeman thought he needed then, he said, because it made him emotional before the biggest game of his life.But it was appropriate, he added, and it worked. It was comforting, said Freddie’s older brother, Andrew, to think of how their mother would have celebrated.“She’d be the first one on that field, running out to bearhug him right now,” Andrew said. “She did everything for us. She didn’t know baseball, so she bought ‘Baseball for Dummies’ to know how to do this thing. She would always wear our buttons — she was the ‘Button Mom’ in Little League — and to think that if she was here today, oh my gosh. It would be absolutely amazing.”Rosemary might have known that her son was bound for stardom. In tee ball at age 6, Freddie hit the ball so hard that he was deemed too dangerous for that division of the North Sunrise Little League in Orange, Calif. He practiced with the 12-year-olds instead.At age 7, Freeman played with the 9-year-olds. At 9, he played with the 12-year-olds. As a senior at El Modena High School, he was chosen by Atlanta in the second round of the 2007 draft. Fred had to sign the contract — for a $409,500 bonus — because Freddie was only 17, and when Freddie grew homesick in the Gulf Coast League, Fred flew to Orlando for two weeks of ballgames on back fields and dinners at Applebee’s.A pattern was established: Freeman would struggle, call dad and find his way.“Even in Triple-A, when he was 20, he’d call me after two weeks and he was batting under .100,” Fred Freeman said. “He said, ‘Dad, I made a mistake, I need to come home, I’m not good enough.’“So I flew out to Charlotte, because they were playing there, and I watched one game and he struck out four times. And I said, ‘Freddie, you’re so excited, there wasn’t one strike that you swung at.’ He said, ‘Really?’ I said, ‘Freddie, they’re bouncing up there. Tomorrow, don’t swing. You can’t do any worse.’ So he walked the first two times on eight pitches, and then the third time up he hit one off the center field fence on the first pitch.”Freeman was in the majors by the end of that 2010 season, playing for a Hall of Fame manager, Bobby Cox, and hitting his first home run off a Hall of Fame pitcher, Roy Halladay. In 11 full seasons in the majors, Freeman has never had a down year.“I don’t know what I’d do without him, quite honestly,” said Braves Manager Brian Snitker. “He’s my rock. I go to him with things. I’ve been with him since the first day he came here in the big leagues. He’s everything that the Braves stand for.”The ball from the final out — thrown by Will Smith, hit by Yuli Gurriel, fielded by Dansby Swanson, caught by Freeman — belongs to Snitker, Freeman said. It was a typical gesture from Freeman, who also turned down General Manager Alex Anthopoulos’s offer to buy him an ice-cream machine for his home as a gift for winning the division.That decision, Freeman conceded, had more to do with upkeep than humility. But he feels a strong bond to the Braves, who rebuilt around him while trading star teammates like Jason Heyward, Craig Kimbrel, Andrelton Simmons and Justin Upton. The team endured four losing seasons in a row during Freeman’s prime, and he never complained.“They didn’t really owe me anything,” he said. “I owed everything to them because they gave me the opportunity to live out a childhood dream. So in my mind, I wanted to do everything I possibly could to help get this team back to winning, because I came up when we were winning.”This was Freeman’s sixth trip to the postseason, and the most unlikely. Atlanta had the fewest victories (88) of any team in the playoff field, and did not nudge their record above .500 for good until Aug. 8.In a doubleheader sweep by the lowly Arizona Diamondbacks in April, Atlanta managed one hit in the first game (by Freeman) and none in the second against Madison Bumgarner. Freeman finished that game with a .205 average.“After that game, I was sitting there with him going, ‘My gosh, this could be a very long year,’” Andrew Freeman said. “And you know what? He’s like, ‘We’re a good team.’ He believed it. He believed this was a good team. He believed they had what it took to win a championship.”A barrage of injuries, most significantly to outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr., could have challenged that belief. But, then, it is hard to pierce Freeman’s aura of positivity.“Freddie was a believer all the way,” said Terry McGuirk, Atlanta’s chairman. “Freddie’s never had a day where he took off and didn’t play hard. That’s the makeup that enabled this team to build around him and create what we have today.”McGuirk added: “You don’t get here without the veteran leaders, and he’s the leader of the veterans.”The end of the World Series also brought an end to Freeman’s eight-year, $135 million contract. He won the National League’s Most Valuable Player Award in 2020, thrived in this postseason (a .304 average with five homers and a 1.045 on-base plus slugging percentage) and will command a rich contract in free agency.Freeman has been open about his wishes — “I think everyone in this room knows I want to stay here,” he said in a news conference during the World Series — and while McGuirk was coy about the future after Game 6, he did say, “Hey, I love him.”McGuirk also said Freeman deserves a spot in the Hall of Fame, and he’s probably right. According to Baseball Reference, the most similar player to Freeman at every age, from 21 through 31, is Eddie Murray, a first-ballot inductee to Cooperstown.If Freeman gets there, the 2021 championship will be etched on his plaque. It is the fulfillment of a wish Freeman shared at his locker in Atlanta one day in 2017, another lost season, when a night like Tuesday seemed as distant as a star above the Texas sky.“Everybody talks about legacies and all that,” Freeman said then. “What’s a legacy without a championship? What’s the point of that? I want to win, and that’s all I care about.”"
68,"With Mammoth Blasts, Jorge Soler Wins World Series M.V.P.",He was hitting .192 when Atlanta traded for him and missed time with the coronavirus. But Soler’s homers put his team ahead in three games in the series.,"Published Nov. 3, 2021","HOUSTON — Growing up in Cuba, Atlanta Braves outfielder Jorge Soler was already so tall by around 9 or 10, his father said, that people didn’t believe his age.“He always wanted to play baseball,” Soler’s father, Jorge Sr., said in Spanish on Tuesday night. “From a young age, he had the talent. And he wanted to play in the big leagues.”These days, Soler, now 29, isn’t simply playing in the big leagues; he is using his towering stature to blast balls entirely of stadiums, guide teams to championships and earn trophies.On Tuesday, in Atlanta’s 7-0 win over the Houston Astros in Game 6 of the World Series that sealed the Braves’ first title since 1995, Soler smashed a mammoth three-run home run that left Minute Maid Park and left his teammates in awe.It was Soler’s third home run of the Series — each of which had given Atlanta the lead in a game. His efforts earned him the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, joining pitcher Livan Hernández of the Florida Marlins in 1997 as the only Cuban-born players to earn the distinction.“This means a lot to me,” Soler said in Spanish, with a Cuban flag draped over his shoulders while holding his daughter as he stood on the confetti-covered infield.“This is the biggest thing that’s happened to me in my career, especially from where I come from, Cuba. It’s harder to reach here and reach the big leagues and have these results. It’s incredible.”In 2011, Soler, at 18, left Cuba on a boat with his father to pursue his baseball dreams, his father said. A year later, he signed a contract with the Chicago Cubs for nine years and $30 million. In 2014, he was called up to the major leagues at 22.Over the next two seasons, Soler flashed his tantalizing but still raw talent. During the Cubs’ World Series-winning season in 2016, he hit .238 with 12 home runs over 86 games but was largely relegated to coming off the bench during the postseason.Traded to the Kansas City Royals that winter, Soler battled injuries, demotions and inconsistency. In 2019, his talent re-emerged: He hit an American League-leading 48 home runs, drove in 117 runs and played in all 162 games. But then his performance slipped over the next two seasons.On July 29 of this season, Soler was hitting .192 with 13 home runs over 94 games with the Royals. Desperate to reinvigorate a team that was floundering and had lost key outfielders such as Ronald Acuña Jr., Atlanta traded the next day for Soler — one of four outfielders the Braves acquired at the trade deadline.“It was challenging at first,” Soler said through an interpreter. “I felt a little out of my comfort zone. I didn’t really know people. It was kind of tough to go to a new place and start making those acquaintances and everything. Within a week, I felt right at home.”Soler blossomed with Atlanta, helping the team reach the postseason. But during the National League division series against the Milwaukee Brewers, Soler, who was unvaccinated, tested positive for the coronavirus and missed 10 days. He returned for the final two games of the N.L. Championship Series, felt bad about not being there for his teammates and vowed to get vaccinated as soon as possible. He then went on a tear during the World Series.“We’ve known what he can do for so long,” Atlanta first baseman Freddie Freeman said. “I mean, two years ago he’s hitting 50 homers. It’s actually pretty incredible what he did in the World Series, getting Covid and missing 10 days and then coming back and not missing a beat. That’s hard to do in this game.”In the first at-bat of the World Series, Soler clobbered a home run. In Game 4, his solo homer put Atlanta on top in a seventh-inning comeback. And in Game 6, he put Atlanta up for good when he connected on a hanging off-speed pitch from the Astros pitcher Luis Garcia and silenced a loud home crowd in Houston.It was Soler’s third go-ahead home run of the World Series. Only Oakland Athletics catcher Gene Tenace in the 1972 World Series hit more such home runs (four).“Off the bat, I was saying, ‘I think it’s got a chance,’” reliever Luke Jackson said. “Then I realized it might never be found again.”The home run’s distance was estimated at 446 feet but felt longer. Because the Minute Maid Park retractable roof was open, the ball flew over the train tracks in left field and, according to security guards, landed in a courtyard.“Oh my God, that was an absolute bomb,” Atlanta reliever Tyler Matzek said of Soler, who is listed at 6-foot-4 and 235 pounds. “He’s one of the most physically gifted people I’ve ever seen in my entire life. He’s like an N.F.L. tight end out there swinging the bat. It’s unbelievable.”After the game, Soler’s father admitted that he thought about their escape from Cuba often because it was a harrowing experience and it is what landed them here, standing on the field after another World Series title, this time with a series M.V.P. trophy.“I’m really proud of what I did and how all of my teammates played as a group,” Jorge Soler said in Spanish, adding later, “I’m really proud of myself and I thank God for the opportunity and the talent.”"
69,"For the Astros, a Stinging Loss and an Uncertain Future","Houston’s experience couldn’t save it in the World Series. With Carlos Correa hinting he might leave, there is no telling what the team might look like next season.","Nov. 3, 2021","HOUSTON — Dusty Baker talked eloquently over the weekend about how this particular group of Houston Astros was gritty and battle-tested. After a win in Atlanta pulled the team to within three games to two in this World Series, he and star shortstop Carlos Correa both spoke of this team’s knack for dramatic comebacks.The harsh reality is, Houston also has plenty of unwanted experience the other way. The Astros now have played in three World Series in the past five years, but in getting trounced, 7-0, in Game 6 on Tuesday night, the Astros have lost two of those three. Making it sting even more, Washington clinched the 2019 title at Houston’s Minute Maid Park, and Atlanta danced on their field this week.“It’s tough, big time,” Baker said after watching Atlanta pitchers hold his Astros to a .224 batting average and .298 on-base percentage during the series and seeing Atlanta out-homer Houston by 11-2. “They played great. We couldn’t keep them in the ballpark. We walked somebody, then that led to the crooked-number innings. The pitching shut us down.”Baker congratulated his counterpart, Brian Snitker, the team and the city of Atlanta. He talked about how “you’ve got to keep on trucking, and that gives you even more incentive next year.” Winters are never easy, but this one comes with particular complications in Houston.The Astros this year were booed relentlessly and could not outrun the cheating scandal that always will hover over their one World Series title, in 2017. Some contended they needed to win another title so that their core group of Correa, Jose Altuve, Alex Bregman and Yuli Gurriel would earn back some semblance of legitimacy for their achievements. Correa said he did not see it that way, eschewing the “outside noise.” Instead, he offered another defense of his team as Tuesday night turned into Wednesday morning.“Second place is not good enough for us,” Correa said. “I know it’s not good enough for you guys. But it speaks volumes of how good our organization, our talent in the clubhouse is. Five A.L.C.S.’s in a row, three World Series in five years. I mean, I don’t know what else you want to ask from a great ball club.”Immediate questions surround the future of both Correa and Baker. Neither the star shortstop nor the manager are signed for next year. When he stepped to the plate in the ninth inning against Atlanta’s closer, Will Smith, Correa acknowledged that he was focused on what he knew could be his farewell.“It was the only thing going through my mind, to be honest,” said Correa, who took two strikes, then a ball, then lined out to right fielder Adam Duvall. “A lot of feelings, mixed emotions. I spent seven years with this club. Yeah, it was going through my mind for sure.”Correa is one formal filing away from free agency. He thanked the Astros owner Jim Crane and the front office for respecting his wishes not to negotiate during the season, but realistically, the odds of him returning are slim. The largest contract the Astros have executed since Crane purchased the team in 2011 was the five-year, $151 million extension signed by Altuve in 2018. With Francisco Lindor banking $341 million over 10 years with the Mets, the price for Correa is likely to stretch well beyond Houston’s comfort zone.In some ways, Correa, a two-time All Star and 2015 A.L. Rookie of the Year, sounded as if he was offering a valedictory address.“To the fans, I want to say thank you for your support,” Correa said. “My time here was amazing, the seven greatest years of my life. I got here as a boy, turned into a man, grew in this city and the fans embraced me.”For Baker, 72, this was another bitter loss. Though he is a three-time manager of the year and has led his teams to 1,987 victories — 12th on the career list — this is the second time he has guided a team to the World Series and lost it. In 2002, his San Francisco Giants led the then-Anaheim Angels three games to two before losing.“I think you get over it,” Baker said. “Other people don’t let you get over it. And other people don’t get over it. To me, we did all we could to get to this point.”He added: “Quite frankly, this one doesn’t hurt quite as much as the first one did because the first one, I thought we had that won, you know what I mean? More than this one.”Baker also has had a run of bad luck to fall just short of the World Series. His 2003 Chicago Cubs were within five outs of the N.L. pennant when a foul ball in the stands, the infamous Steve Bartman play, derailed their season. In his two seasons managing the Washington Nationals, his teams won 95 and 97 games, each earning the N.L. East title. Yet he was fired.In Houston, he maneuvered the Astros to within one win of the A.L. pennant during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season before losing Game 7 to Tampa Bay. Then this.“I feel bad. I feel terrible because I’m not really ready to go home,” Baker said. “I haven’t been home since I left in February, so you know I must love these guys and love what I’m doing. I mean, when’s the last time you weren’t home? It’s dang near, I looked on the calendar today and it’s almost Thanksgiving.”Baker made it clear he hopes he is back because, after this loss, he said, he’s “still got some unfinished business.”If he is back, it will be with a team that most likely will be significantly altered. Correa’s return is in doubt. The ace Justin Verlander, who missed all season after having Tommy John surgery, is a free agent. So, too, are the starter Zack Greinke and the key relievers Kendall Graveman, Brooks Raley and Yimi Garcia.“I’d be sad, but like I said, he’s not a free agent yet,” Jose Altuve said of Correa’s possible departure, adding, “I haven’t lost my hopes.”Bregman, too, lobbied for the Astros to do what it takes to keep Correa.“He’s one of the smartest baseball players in the world,” said Bregman, who badly struggled in this World Series, batting just .095 (2 for 21) with two R.B.I. and no home runs. “And he’s one of the hardest working. He eats, sleeps and breathes the game. It’s been honestly amazing to play with him.”The seasons are long and the endings, for the nine teams who play in the postseason and leave it off a loss, are harsh. Summers come with no guarantees, and after playing in the A.L.C.S. in five consecutive seasons and winning only one World Series, it was difficult enough for the Astros to believe that they wouldn’t be forcing Atlanta into a Game 7 on Wednesday.“I mean, it really hurts,” Baker said. “But it’s over.”"
70,Max Fried Lost Game 2. Then He Pitched Atlanta to a Title.,Atlanta’s ace erased the memory of a bad outing by keeping Houston off balance and throwing six scoreless innings.,,"HOUSTON — Max Fried had last left Minute Maid Park’s mound in frustration.Back then, just last Wednesday, he surrendered six runs and was the losing pitcher in Game 2 of the World Series. His manager thought the outing was a fluke; Fried thought he had failed.Whether he did or not is no longer relevant: Fried won Game 6 on Tuesday night and Atlanta captured its first World Series title in 26 years. In six innings, the left-hander allowed four hits and held a mighty Houston offense — one that had led the majors in runs, hits and batting average — scoreless. He recorded six strikeouts and walked no one in his ninth career postseason start.And in a series where relievers found plenty of work, whether by managerial design or desperation or both, Fried did not reach 70 pitches until there were two outs in the sixth. In the end, he threw 74. Two more Atlanta pitchers, Tyler Matzek and Will Smith, finished off the Astros, who were also done in by mighty swings from Jorge Soler, Dansby Swanson and Freddie Freeman.“I just told myself that I was going to go out there and be 100 percent me and just try to pitch and try to win a ballgame,” Fried said. “Just kind of the same mentality that I had in the second half: just go out there and keep guys off-balance, just kind of pitch unorthodox and pitch with my eyes.”He used a slider to strike out Carlos Correa, Houston’s All-Star shortstop. Yuli Gurriel, the American League batting champion, went down on three straight fastballs. Alex Bregman, with a Silver Slugger Award on his résumé, also faltered when he faced Fried’s fastball.“He was way better than the first game,” said Jose Altuve, who has spent his entire career in Houston and is one of the game’s best batters. “He pitched good. He didn’t use his curveball too much tonight, but fastball, slider, changeup was really good. He was almost unhittable.”Tom Glavine, the winning pitcher in the Game 6 that clinched the World Series for Atlanta in 1995, zeroed in on how Fried had gone after right-handed hitters.“Thought he made a nice subtle adjustment by using FB and changeup away tonight to keep those righties honest,” he wrote in a text message, referencing Fried’s fastball, the very first pitch he fired on Tuesday night.Indeed, Fried, 27, had made clear before Game 6 that he had no intention of overhauling his approach to Houston’s lineup. He was looking to make tweaks, though he did throw harder on Tuesday night than he had at any other point in the season.“It’s just sticking with your strengths, pitching my game and really just trusting what we see with our eyes,” he said this week. “We’re going to make adjustments. At this time of year, it’s about just getting outs. So whatever we can do to get outs is what the plan of attack is going to be.”Atlanta’s pitching coach, Rick Kranitz, said that Fried was among the best he had seen at drawing up his own game plan.“He knows exactly what he wants to do — exactly,” Kranitz said on the infield dirt after the game. “Now it’s time to get into the flow of the game, like a lot of starters, because if you don’t get him early, you’re probably not going to get him and he showed that tonight.”But Fried’s night could have very ended in the first inning, when he galloped backward toward first base to help play a ground ball. He extended his right foot toward the bag — and then the right foot of Michael Brantley, who had scurried up the line, slammed into the back of Fried’s foot and onto his ankle.It could have become a nightmare revisited for Atlanta, which lost its starting pitcher in Game 1, Charlie Morton, to a broken leg. But after a trainer evaluated Fried, Tuesday’s starter stuck around.With two runners on, no one out and a pitcher who was, at the very least, likely to be left feeling the play, it was a gamble for Atlanta. Fried responded by striking out two of the next three hitters, and provoking a grounder from the other.“When that happened, I think he just locked it in,” Kranitz said of the collision that, he joked, threatened to send the pitcher and his coach to the hospital together.Fried retired the Astros in order for four consecutive innings. In the sixth, his last frame of the night, Brantley managed an infield single with two outs. Then Fried struck out Correa again.And Smith, watching from the Atlanta bullpen, was unsurprised. He had sensed earlier Tuesday that Fried would harass the Houston lineup for as long as he was on the mound.“If Max has a bad one, he’s more driven and really wants to get it done the next time out,” Smith said. “He had this look on his face all day. He was nice and relaxed when he first got in the clubhouse today, but he was motivated, he was driven. He looked like a different Max, honestly.”Different enough to go from loser to winner — and World Series champion — in six days."
71,Atlanta Overcomes Decades of Frustration to Win World Series,"A dominant all-around effort secured a Game 6 win, allowing an 88-win team to beat the Houston Astros and triumph at a stage that more celebrated Braves teams of the past usually struggled.","Published Nov. 2, 2021","HOUSTON — So, this is the Braves team that found a way to match the great Atlanta teams of the 1990s. This team, with no trio of Hall of Fame aces, no legendary manager and no backlog of World Series experience to build on, somehow found a way.The current edition of Atlanta’s storied ball club could never equal the star power of its forebears, but it has already drawn even with them in championship trophies, achieving in one trip to baseball’s mountaintop what its predecessors could do only once in five tries.On a cool Tuesday night with the roof open at Minute Maid Park, Atlanta beat the Houston Astros, 7-0, in Game 6 to win the World Series in its first appearance in the Fall Classic since 1999, and capture Atlanta’s first title in 26 years.“This city has been hungry for a championship for so long,” said Freddie Freeman, the longest-serving member of the team, who homered and caught the final out. “I cannot wait to see the crowds in the next couple days when we get back home. I’m just so thankful that we were able to bring them home a championship.”It was the first title for the club since 1995, back when an extraordinary collection of superstar pitchers and multitalented position players like Chipper Jones and Fred McGriff, backed by the Hall of Fame Manager Bobby Cox, won the first major championship for the city of Atlanta.Those great teams were expected to win multiple rings. But they did not win a championship until their third appearance in the World Series, played in five overall, and despite a wealth of talent, never won another.The 2021 team, under Manager Brian Snitker, features lesser-known players like Jorge Soler and Dansby Swanson, both of whom hit thunderous home runs to propel Atlanta on Tuesday. Soler blasted a three-run shot in the third inning, and Swanson crushed a two-run homer in the fifth.Many teams, like the Mariners, Rockies, Rangers, Padres and Brewers, would happily accept a solitary championship. But the old Atlanta teams, which won more than 100 games six times, bore the heavy tag of underachievers, especially with a pitching staff anchored by Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz, and the franchise won 14 consecutive divisional crowns (there was no division title in the strike-shortened 1994 season).The current squad bears scant resemblance to those teams, for it was not expected to make the World Series this year, much less win it.“It’s way different,” said Eddie Perez, a coach on the current team, who made his debut as a player in 1995. “You know why? Because we had to fight here. Back then, we knew we had a good team and that it was only a matter of time before we would win. Here, this year, we went through so much and look where we are now. I never thought we were going to be here.”It is a plucky assemblage of overachievers that could barely cobble together a full starting pitching staff, let alone one of the greatest ever assembled.But Max Fried was a worthy descendant of that lineage, pitching six shutout innings for the win, and helping to restore the image of the starting pitcher in a postseason dominated by relievers.The team had a year marked by injuries, and the controversy surrounding Major League Baseball’s decision to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta, but the Braves somehow bent the rest of baseball to its will, forcing Manfred to hand over the coveted trophy. When he did, several thousand fans standing behind the visitors dugout, booed loudly.It all seemed so improbable back in July when Atlanta lost its best player, outfielder Ronald Acuña, Jr., to a torn knee ligament. In early August, the team was a game under .500 and in third place in the National League East. But General Manager Alex Anthopoulos made a string of moves at the trade deadline to bolster the lineup, adding Soler, Eddie Rosario and Adam Duval, among others.Soler was named the most valuable player of the World Series, and Rosario was the M.V.P. of the National League Championship Series, making Atlanta the first team to have acquired both of those award winners via trades in the same year.But in the regular season the Braves won only 88 games, the fewest of the 10 playoff teams. In their division series Soler tested positive for the coronavirus and missed several games. The team’s most dependable veteran starter, Charlie Morton suffered a broken leg in the Game 1 of the World Series.“We hit every pothole, every bump you could possibly hit this year,” Freeman said, “and somehow the car still made it onto the other side. It’s just an incredible group.”Game 6 began amid a noisy throng of orange-clad Houston fans hoping to see their team finish a comeback from a three-games-to-one deficit. But when Soler hit his atmospheric blast an estimated 446 feet, clear over the train tracks above the left field stands, thousands of Atlanta fans revealed themselves amid the suddenly quiet crowd in Houston.Luis Garcia, Houston’s starting pitcher, was one strike away from escaping the inning, but he hung a slider to Soler, who smashed it onto the street outside the stadium. Soler dropped his bat, turned to his dugout, tapped his chest twice and before running the bases, yelled something toward his teammates.“I just said, ‘I’m here,’” he explained through an interpreter, and he was not exaggerating.It was Soler’s third home run of the series, and he joined Hank Aaron, who did the same in 1957 for the Milwaukee Braves, Lonnie Smith (1991) and Ryan Klesko (1995) as the franchise’s only players to hit three home runs in a World Series.In the fifth inning, Swanson, the No. 9 hitter, blasted a two-run home run off Cristian Javier.Freeman’s home run in the seventh — along with his R.B.I. double in the fifth — accounted for the final two Atlanta runs and provided the perfect exclamation for a World Series that will not be remembered long outside of Atlanta.Only two of the games featured lead changes and four of the six games were decided by at least four runs.But it was a thing of beauty for Atlantans, who have yearned for another champion for most of the last 26 years, but often found sporting heartbreak instead.Atlanta lost the World Series in 1991, 1992, 1996 and 1999, and the N.F.L.’s Falcons catastrophically collapsed in the Super Bowl after the 2016 season, when the New England Patriots wiped out a 25-point deficit with a little over 18 minutes to play and won the game in overtime. The Atlanta Dream lost three W.N.B.A. finals in a four-year span. Yes, the city’s Major League Soccer team, Atlanta United, won the M.L.S. Cup in 2018, but had existed for only two years at that point.The Braves also won championships in Boston in 1914 and in Milwaukee in 1957.For the Astros, it was a missed opportunity to win a championship devoid of taint and controversy. Houston won the World Series in 2017 but was later found to have used illicit means to steal and transmit opponents’ signals throughout the season. The scheme came to light before the 2020 season, and ever since the Astros, who led the majors in runs scored this season, have been heckled as “cheaters” by fans of opposing teams.Carlos Correa, the shortstop, who could leave the team in free agency this off-season, said the players could not control what he called the “outside noise.”“Second place is not good enough for us,” he said. “But it speaks volumes of how good our organization, our talent in the clubhouse is. Five A.L.C.S. in a row, three World Series in five years. I mean, I don’t know what else you want to ask from a great ball club.”The loss also stung for Manager Dusty Baker, the popular skipper who has yet to win a World Series in 24 seasons as a manager — though he is the only manager to take five different teams to the postseason. Baker managed the Giants when they lost to the Angels in Game 7 of the 2002 World Series.“It’s tough, but you know something, you’ve got to keep on trucking,” Baker said, “and that gives you even more incentive next year. It’s tough to take now, but this too shall pass. I mean, it really hurts, but it’s over.”The final out of the season came on a bouncing ball off the bat of Yuli Gurriel. Swanson caught it and fired to Freeman at first base. Who better than the player drafted by Atlanta in 2007 to make the final out and tuck the ball safely into his back pocket before celebrating with his teammates.“When I got to first and turned and he started throwing it to me, I was like, ‘Oh, man, I’m going to catch the last out of the World Series,’” Freeman said. “Pretty special.”It was also special in 1995, when Marquis Grissom caught the final out for Atlanta. But that team was expected to win. The 2021 version is Atlanta’s pleasant surprise."
72,The Best Decisions Happen When the Manager Should be Sleeping,"A World Series manager’s life is full of distractions. For Dusty Baker, Brian Snitker and their predecessors, the middle of the night offers time to think about the game.",,"HOUSTON — World Series pressure never rests, and neither do the participating managers. A good night’s sleep? Good luck. That can wait.When Houston’s Dusty Baker decided to move the slumping Alex Bregman down to seventh in the lineup for Game 5 against Atlanta on Sunday, it was not a thunderbolt idea that struck as he was filling out the lineup card in his office before the game.“Usually, the thoughts come to me in the middle of the night, like most of them do,” Baker said. That’s exactly when the Bregman idea hatched, he said, overnight Saturday, “when I should have been sleeping.”His Atlanta counterpart, Brian Snitker, can relate.“You toss and turn and wake up and go to the bathroom, I get a lot of things the same way,” Snitker said on the field before Game 6 on Tuesday. “Or if you think of something, you want to sleep on it and see how you feel the next day. There’s been stuff that comes to me in the middle of the night. It’s just one of those instinctual things that hits you.”These middle-of-the-night moments come two at a time, packaged during the week or 10 days’ worth of heavy pressure and light sleep. Beyond the two managers leading the current teams, there are a select few other men who know exactly what this whirlwind experience is like.“You’re so busy,” said Bruce Bochy, who guided the San Francisco Giants to World Series titles in 2010, 2012 and 2014. “You have so many responsibilities. Your time is when you get away from the park and back to your room at night.”But even then, a manager is not so alone.“When you lay your head down, that’s when your head starts to work,” Bochy said.By day, World Series managers face responsibilities with their baseball operations departments, players and coaches. They are heavily scheduled for news media interviews and television obligations. There are fleeting moments for family members in town to help share these moments of a lifetime. There are ticket requests that can become consuming. The days seem too short for a manager to cover every detail while also attempting enjoy the culmination of a life’s work.By night, alone with their thoughts and the latest game result churning in their stomachs, managers often find their brains working overtime to find peace amid a cacophony of sleep-delaying obstacles that can include distant, poignant family memories, television remote controls, Scotch and, even, peanut butter.“These things, they come to me, and you can’t really control when they come,” Baker said of the thoughts that dance through his mind at night. “Like my dad used to tell me, some things you’ve got to sleep on. So I’ll try to sleep on it.”Managers have slept on worse during a World Series. Cleveland’s Terry Francona revealed on the day of Game 7 against the Chicago Cubs in 2016 that he had a terrible nightmare the night before, dreaming that somebody “was breaking my ribs.”“I woke up and my ribs hurt,” Francona said then. “I kind of got scared.”As he was regaining consciousness, he said, he reached down to feel his rib cage and discovered no broken bones, but that the TV remote was “like, stuck in my rib cage. Evidently, I had slept on it for a couple of hours. I got up to go to the bathroom and, I mean, it hurt.“It’s not easy being a manager. My bedroom looked like a national disaster last night.”That wasn’t the end of it. Francona also woke up with peanut butter on his glasses, he said, because he had been dipping pretzels into a jar of peanut butter as he fell asleep in bed.“I go straight home and I hit the bed and everything’s laid out next to me,” Francona said. “And I fell asleep at some point while eating. I wake up sometimes in the middle of the night, and I’ll just reach over and grab something. Unfortunately, it’s true.”Baker said he generally enjoys one glass of Scotch before bed — “I don’t need it, I just like it” — and falls asleep quickly. But he called himself a “mid-sleep insomniac,” as diagnosed by a friend of his who is a clinical psychologist.“I wake up in the middle of the night,” Baker said. “I can go to sleep in 30 seconds, but then 3, 3:30 in the morning, my brain wakes me up with lineup changes or thoughts that I have to say to somebody or something. I always keep a pencil or pen by my bed and a piece of paper and write it down or else I’ll forget some of those great thoughts that I had in the middle of the night when I should be asleep.”Bochy understands.“Things are going through your head constantly,” Bochy said. “After the game you’ve got the media and everything, and by the time you get back to the hotel you’ve got all kinds of thoughts that can maybe help the club — a lineup change, going through your pitching, thoughts on what you want to convey to the club. Your mind is going nonstop, and it continues into the next day.”He vividly remembers the night before Game 7 in Kansas City in 2014. “We got smoked in Game 6,” Bochy recalled — 10-0, in a game that evened the series at three games apiece.“So you get back to the room and you’re thinking, ‘OK, how are we going to work through this? We’ve got Tim Hudson starting Game 7, how can we use Bumgarner?’” Bochy said. “All of this is going through your head.”Of course, in one of the more memorable moments of any World Series, after Hudson went one and two-thirds innings the next day and Jeremy Affeldt bridged the next two and a third innings, the Kauffman Stadium bullpen gate swung open and Madison Bumgarner emerged. After throwing a shutout three days before, Bumgarner shut down the Royals over the last five innings as the Giants won their third title in five years.Sorting through those thoughts in his hotel room on a Tuesday night in Kansas City did not cost Bochy as much sleep as his first time piloting the Giants in the World Series, when they took a lead of three games to one over Texas in 2010. That’s when his brother, Joe, starting kidding him: If you blow this one …“Listen, I didn’t sleep at all that night,” Bochy said. “You just lay there tossing and turning. Morning comes and you’ve got to get up.“You’re running on adrenaline. Adrenaline is a wonderful drug.”Though he is managing a World Series for the first time, Snitker said he learned long ago that sleep is at a premium.“That’s probably one of the hardest things you have to encounter here after experiencing it,” he acknowledged. “The games are so long, the days are so long. It’s hard to get to bed at a decent hour. You’re never hungry. And you don’t sleep good. I sleep like a baby: I wake up every two hours and cry.“It’s hard to get into the routines and all that stuff. But you know what? I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’ll have a time to sleep over the next couple days.”When Snitker and his wife, Ronnie, were talking earlier this year about his eventual retirement, she told him that it would be nice when he doesn’t wake up worrying about something every morning.“Yeah, but I’m really good at worrying,” Brian told her, chuckling."
73,Mets Fire Their Interim G.M. Two Months After His Arrest,Zack Scott was placed on leave on Sept. 1. He had been charged with driving while intoxicated.,,"Zack Scott is the latest Mets executive to leave the team under a dark cloud. Scott was let go by the Mets on Monday, two months after he was placed on administrative leave, according to a baseball executive who had been briefed on the matter but could not speak publicly about it.SNY, the Mets television network, reported the news first.After many years in the Boston Red Sox organization, Scott was hired by the Mets in December to be an assistant general manager. He was promoted to general manager on an interim basis after Jared Porter was fired from his post in January following allegations that he had sexually harassed a female reporter.Scott oversaw a team that won only 77 games and that fired Manager Luis Rojas shortly after the season ended. But Scott’s position in the organization had become untenable after he was arrested in White Plains, N.Y., on a drunken-driving charge. That case is still pending.After Scott was suspended, Sandy Alderson, the team’s president, stepped in to fulfill the duties of general manager, but the team is looking to hire a permanent president of baseball operations so that Alderson can retreat into a broader role as an adviser to the team owner, Steven Cohen.The team has so far failed to land any of the well-known targets for the president’s job, like Theo Epstein and Billy Beane, so it is said to now be looking for a younger, less experienced person to take over the operation."
74,The Recipe for Coming Back From a 3-1 Deficit? It Varies.,The Houston Astros are trying to pull off a feat that has been done only six times in the World Series. Players from the teams that did it happily recalled their thrilling comebacks.,,"HOUSTON — In the somber moments after the Pittsburgh Pirates lost Game 4 of the 1979 World Series to the Baltimore Orioles to fall behind three games to one, Willie Stargell spoke to his teammates.Stargell, the Hall of Fame slugger, who commanded that wild, boisterous team with a well-placed glance as much as with a stern word, tried to make certain that, as much fun as the players had, they played to their capabilities. But to that point in the World Series they had not. They were on the precipice of elimination.“Willie just told us, ‘Millions of people are watching and they have not seen the real Pirates,’” said Kent Tekulve, the Pirates’ closer at the time. “He said, ‘Whatever happens, let’s at least show them one game how the Buccos really play baseball.’”The Bucs gave the viewers at home three real Pirates games in a row and won the World Series. They are one of only six teams out of 48 that fell into a daunting three-games-to-one hole in a best-of-seven series, only to climb out and win the World Series.The Houston Astros are a third of the way to making it seven teams. They beat Atlanta in Game 5 on Sunday and they trail three games to two in the Series. Game 6 is on Tuesday at their home park, where they hope to win twice and join the 2016 Cubs, the 1985 Royals, the 1968 Tigers, the 1958 Yankees, the 1925 Pirates and of course, the ’79 “We Are Family” Pirates.“I never doubted we could do it,” said Jim Rooker, the Pirates’ starter in Game 5 of that series. “We had a bunch of fun, crazy guys, and that definitely helps.”But there is no clear formula for how to stave off elimination three straight times to win a World Series, no blueprint easily transferable across decades. The ’79 Pirates relied on many things, including motivation supplied by the mayor of Baltimore, who announced the parade route before Game 5.“After each win we joked, ‘We just canceled a parade,’” Tekulve said. “‘Let’s cancel another one.’”In 2016, the Chicago Cubs were clearly tight when the World Series began. Shouldering the burden of more than a century of failure had doomed many Cubs pretenders before them, and that team started out that way, too.But after a narrow victory in Game 5 on Oct. 30, management allowed the Cubs’ players to remain in Chicago for the day off. Instead of another day of batting practice and interviews in Cleveland, the players remained behind in Chicago to celebrate Halloween with their families.David Ross, the team’s catcher, took his kids to join Ryan Dempster’s family for trick-or-treating in the Wrigleyville neighborhood. When they rang doorbells, people held bags of candy and wore stunned expressions on their faces to see that Cubs players were at their doors, instead of grinding away in a batting cage in Cleveland.“People were freaking out,” Ross said, “But we were able to relax and have fun and then just kind of reset. I think it made a big difference.”Later that night, many of the players wore costumes on the plane, which left Chicago around 9 p.m., and that loose group won the next two games in Cleveland and ended a 108-year drought.In 1985, the Royals faced disaster after losing Game 4 in St. Louis. But that group had the unusual distinction of already knowing it could overcome a 3-1 deficit, because it had just done so in the American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays.John Wathan, the Royals’ veteran catcher, recalled an interview he gave before the pivotal Game 5 of the World Series that encapsulated the team’s attitude.“I said on the radio that teams win three games in a row all the time during the regular season,” he said on Monday. “It’s not that hard. We knew we could do it.”Wathan also noted that the ’85 Royals, like the ’79 Pirates and the 2021 Astros, had a veteran core that never panicked. He said Manager Dick Howser would tell the players what Dusty Baker has told the Astros.“He’d say, ‘You know you can do it,’” Wathan recalled. “‘Now just go out there and do it.’”It helped that Kansas City had a virtuosic pitching staff that included Danny Jackson, Charlie Leibrandt, Dan Quisenberry and the 21-year-old sensation Bret Saberhagen. The Pirates also had an impressive staff in 1979, with Bert Blyleven, John Candelaria and Jim Bibby. But Rooker, who had been injured, was the surprise starter for Game 5. He threw four shutout innings before allowing a run in the fifth, and Blyleven pitched four shutout innings in relief.But on their way to Three Rivers Stadium that morning, the players learned that Manager Chuck Tanner’s mother had died. Tekulve recalled that the players, normally boisterous and loud, sat glumly with their backs to their lockers, staring into the middle of the clubhouse, not knowing how to approach Tanner, or what to say.Finally, not long before batting practice, Tanner appeared in the home clubhouse and told the players, “I know you heard about my mother. She knew we were in trouble, and she went to get help.”It was the perfect approach.“He knew exactly what to say that would allow us to get back to work,” Tekulve said. “He was letting us know it was OK.”After Game 5, the Pirates went to Baltimore, and on the day off before Game 6, Rooker was surprised to hear Orioles fans on the street tell him that the Pirates had the series in the bag.“It was weird,” Rooker said. “They felt like we did, that we were going to win.”They did not know that before Game 6, Candelaria’s back was so sore, a teammate had to tie his spikes for him. Somehow, Candelaria threw six scoreless innings and Tekulve tossed the last three to complete the shutout.Courageous performances like that are also a helpful tool when trying to overcome a 3-1 deficit.“John was one of the toughest guys I ever played with,” Tekulve said.Tekulve was tough, too. Over the last few games, he kept telling himself it was July 16, not October. He carried that approach into the ninth inning of Game 7 and after he recorded two strikeouts and the ball went around the horn, Tekulve took it back from Bill Madlock, the third baseman.“Twenty-five other teams went into spring training looking for this out,” he said. “We’re the ones who are going to find it.”So, the lessons on how to come back from a 3-1 deficit include tough, confident veterans; compassionate managers; a little trick-or-treating; mayors with big mouths and a rekindled confidence after losing three times.“We were down 3-1, now we’re still down 3-2,” Astros shortstop Carlos Correa said after Sunday’s Game 5. “I truly believe, if there’s one team that can accomplish that in this league, it’s us.”"
75,Gary Bettman Defends N.H.L.’s Response to Sexual Abuse Accusation,The commissioner spoke publicly to address criticism of the way the league handled a player’s sexual assault accusation against a former Chicago coach.,"Nov. 1, 2021","N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman on Monday defended the league’s response to a sexual assault accusation against a former coach.Kyle Beach, a career minor leaguer now playing in Germany, has said that he was sexually assaulted in 2010 by Brad Aldrich, then a Chicago Blackhawks video coach. An independent investigation commissioned this year by the team found that officials had not reported the accusation against Aldrich to the league or to law enforcement because they did not want a distraction during the team’s playoff run.Aldrich resigned from the team following that season, but only after Chicago won the Stanley Cup and after he had made a sexual advance toward an intern at the celebration, the investigative report, which was released Tuesday, said. Aldrich received a playoff bonus, and his name was engraved on the Cup.He later held several other jobs in hockey and pleaded guilty to sexual contact with a minor while he was a high school coach in Michigan, where he is a registered sex offender.“It is clear that what happened was inappropriate and wrong on every level and was not handled correctly by the Blackhawks organization,” Bettman said in a conference call with reporters. “This certainly has been a disturbing week for all of us.”Of Beach, who met with the commissioner on Saturday, Bettman said, “I am sorry for what he has been through, and thought he has been courageous, especially the past week.”The league has been criticized as being slow to respond to Beach’s accusation. “Until last Monday, we had not seen the report in any form,” Bettman said.Joel Quenneville, who was the head coach of the Blackhawks in 2010, resigned as the Florida Panthers’ coach on Thursday, but was permitted to lead the team in a game on Wednesday, the day after details of the accusation emerged.Defending that decision, Bettman said: “He had already coached 800 games since 2010, and I wanted to make sure that no one could say I prejudged him. People can disagree.” As a matter of due process, Bettman said, “I needed to meet him in person.”Kevin Cheveldayoff, who was an assistant general manager for the Blackhawks in 2010 and has said he attended a meeting about the accusation then, is now the Winnipeg Jets’ general manager. He was not punished by the league.Cheveldayoff “was such a minor player in this,” Bettman said. “Because of his limited authority and circumstance, he left the meeting” in 2010 thinking the matter would be investigated by higher-ups.“He believed the matter had been appropriately taken care of” because of Aldrich’s eventual departure from the club, Bettman said.After the release of the investigation report last week, the N.H.L. fined the Blackhawks $2 million for what it called their “insufficient and untimely response.” Some fans and journalists have pointed out that the penalty was $1 million less than the league initially fined the Devils in 2010 for circumventing the salary cap. Bettman contended that the fine against Chicago was “substantial.”Stan Bowman, the Blackhawks’ president of hockey operations, and Al MacIsaac, the senior director of hockey administration, resigned last week in the aftermath of the report. Bowman also resigned as the general manager of the 2022 United States Olympic men’s ice hockey team.Bettman said Monday that he would have to review any request to return to the league from any of the people who left in connection with the matter.Beach’s accusation, although not his identity, was first made public in May in a lawsuit filed against the Blackhawks. That lawsuit has yet to be resolved. Aldrich claimed that any sexual encounter had been consensual, but Beach said Aldrich had threatened violence, as well as damage to his hockey career, if he didn’t comply.Beach, Chicago’s first-round draft pick in 2008, was with the team in 2010 as what is known as a “black ace,” a minor leaguer who travels with the team during the playoffs in case he is needed because of an injury or a suspension.The N.H.L. Players’ Association has also received scrutiny, including from Beach, for its handling of the accusation. During a call on Monday with player representatives who make up the union’s executive board, Donald Fehr, the executive director of the players’ union, “recommended that an independent investigation be commenced by outside legal counsel” to review the union’s response, Jonathan Weatherdon, an N.H.L.P.A. spokesman, said in a statement.The executive board will vote on commissioning an investigation, the statement said. Fehr, a former chief of the Major League Baseball players’ union, began his role with the N.H.L.’s union in December 2010.The investigative report commissioned by the Blackhawks was released at a time when the league and the sport in general have been under the microscope because of other incidents of abuse, misogyny and racism. Players in a Canadian amateur league have filed a lawsuit saying they were sexually and physically assaulted as a part of hazing. A former minor league coach said he had been fired by the Pittsburgh Penguins after he reported that his wife had been sexually assaulted by one of his bosses. Misogynistic online messages by top N.H.L. players and an accusation of a racial slur used by a coach have also come to light.“The N.H.L. has made considerable progress from where it was a decade ago,” Bettman said. “If you listen to what N.H.L. personnel, especially the players, have been saying this week, you know things have been changing.“I believe most of our personnel are good people who do the right thing.”"
76,"A Grand Slam Wasted, Atlanta Is Left Holding Its Breath",Adam Duvall’s blast felt like the where-were-you-when moment Atlanta has been seeking for decades. And then it wasn’t.,"Published Nov. 1, 2021","ATLANTA — Of course, it was too easy. Here, it almost always is.All the Atlanta Braves needed to do to capture their first World Series championship in 26 years was win one last game at home, in the stadium where they had already gone 7-0 this postseason. And in the first inning of Game 5 on Sunday, when Adam Duvall whacked a sinker 377 feet for a grand slam, it seemed like Atlanta — city and namesake suburban baseball team alike — had found the where-were-you-when moment it had been seeking for decades.Of course, it was too easy. Truist Park’s final game of 2021 ended not with a championship roar that had been building since the first inning, but a loss, 9-5, to the Houston Astros in Monday’s first minutes.“It’s not over yet!” one of Atlanta’s chronically upbeat stadium announcers shouted after the final out.But, Atlantans knew in the middle of a spectacular autumn night, it could have been. They, in fact, say it should have been. They say it almost instinctively, the situation and the script almost a perverse rite of life in Georgia.“We knew we had a long, long way to go in that game and anything could happen,” Brian Snitker, Atlanta’s manager, said. “It would have been great if we could have kept adding on. We just weren’t able to do that.”Whenever Atlanta’s road trip concludes in Houston, where Game 6 will be played on Tuesday night, Snitker’s overachieving team will return home with one of two unshakable markers for history: as a World Series champion, or as the seventh team to lose it all after leading, three games to one, in a best-of-seven series.Atlanta knows something about sacrificing such a daunting margin: The Braves did it last year in the National League Championship Series, losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the eventual World Series winners. (Atlanta beat the Dodgers in this year’s N.L.C.S.)“It taught us to never take our foot off the gas, and everybody in that clubhouse understands that,” Will Smith, Atlanta’s closer, said of that episode ahead of Game 5.Atlanta has good reason to remain upbeat besides a good team and a 3-2 series lead: It has not lost consecutive games since mid-September, Max Fried is expected to start at Minute Maid Park on Tuesday and no team has won the World Series on its home field since 2013.The foreboding thought, though, is the notion that maybe this team will prove to be too much like the 19 Atlanta baseball teams that reached the postseason since 1991 and didn’t win a World Series than like the one team that did, in 1995.Atlanta’s professional sports teams, after all, long ago mastered the art of civic disappointment and, sometimes, heartbreak.Although the Atlanta United won the M.L.S. Cup in 2018 and the Campeones Cup in 2019, the Hawks, in the N.B.A., have gone 63 seasons without a title. The Thrashers, the former N.H.L. team, existed for 12 seasons and made the playoffs once.And then there was the debacle in the Super Bowl that ended the 2016 N.F.L. season — played in Houston, of all places — when the Atlanta Falcons enjoyed a 25-point lead until the final three minutes of the third quarter and still managed to lose to the New England Patriots.But the subject of consternation here has most often been a baseball franchise that, thanks to the era of TBS and Ted Turner, is more a Southern team than an Atlanta team (or a Cobb County team). Its résumé from the 1990s and 2000s glimmers with N.L. East titles, occasional pennants and six Hall of Famers — four players, a manager and a general manager — but only the one championship.It is true that this World Series has gone better than Atlanta’s last one, in 1999, when the Yankees swept. It is true that, with two wins, Truist Park now has more Atlanta World Series victories in it than Turner Field had. It is true that Atlanta still has two more chances.The team’s hope is that baseball’s recent history, not Atlanta’s long one, will guide the rest of the series after the Commissioner’s Trophy was won at a neutral site in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic.The last team to claim a World Series at home was the 2013 Boston Red Sox when they toppled the St. Louis Cardinals in six games after trailing, two games to one.In the last 20 years — for many of them, the All-Star Game determined home-field advantage in the World Series — seven teams have won the title at their home park: the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, the 2002 Anaheim Angels, the 2006 St. Louis Cardinals, the 2008 Philadelphia Phillies, the 2009 Yankees, the 2011 St. Louis Cardinals and that Boston team in 2013.There are some perks to home-field advantage, which Houston enjoys in this series because of its superior regular-season record. Some are apparent, like familiarity with the playing surface, with how balls bounce off the outfield wall and even with the music. (Minute Maid Park was also, infamously, the hub of the Astros’ sign-stealing scheme.)“You saw how loud this place got these three days,” Marwin Gonzalez, who served as a pinch-hitter for Houston in Game 5, said before the American League champions left Atlanta. “That gives an extra bounce.” He added, “For us going back to Houston, we gave ourselves a chance to go game by game and to get the Game 6.”But the 2019 World Series, in which the Astros played the Washington Nationals, stands as some of the clearest evidence that home-field advantage is overstated and makes little difference in performance, mostly because the road team won all seven games.And despite the weight of a 108-year World Series title drought, the Chicago Cubs overcame any challenges of playing a decisive Game 7 on the road and beat Cleveland in 2016.Snitker said he would have preferred to win at home, where, before and during Sunday’s game, the plazas and streets around the ballpark, the center of a mixed-use development called the Battery, overflowed with Atlanta fans. But, he added, “I’ll take it anywhere.”“I don’t care where we’re at,” he said. “If we win the World Series, it doesn’t matter where it is. I’d have loved to have done it in front of our fans. Hopefully, we can do it the next couple of days.”Maybe so. Quite possibly so.But there were signs everywhere of what could have been on Sunday. Inside the park, cases of beer and Champagne earmarked for a championship celebration sat unopened. Outside, the Battery was a graveyard for empty cups, beer cans and pizza boxes.Atlanta had missed another opportunity. All it could do, again, was wait and brace and hope."
77,"A World Series of Relievers, Like It or Not","Injuries have forced things to extremes for both Houston and Atlanta, with bullpens accounting for more than 60 percent of all innings pitched. This was not by design.","Nov. 1, 2021","ATLANTA — Greg Maddux leads all living people in major league victories, with 355. He tossed the ceremonial first pitch before Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday at Truist Park. Tucker Davidson is tied with roughly 7.8 billion other people for last place in major league victories, with zero. He threw the first pitch that counted.“Walking out to the bullpen to warm up, I definitely soaked it in,” Davidson said later, after the Houston Astros beat Atlanta, 9-5. “People were chanting my name, kind of taking that all in. Whenever you get out there, it felt like another game.”Another game, that is, in this most unusual World Series, which the Atlanta Braves lead, three games to two, as the scene shifts to Houston for Game 6 on Tuesday. Davidson collected six outs in his sixth major league start, which made him seem like a durable workhorse like Old Hoss Radbourn compared to Atlanta’s Game 4 starter, Dylan Lee, who got one out in his first major league start.“I was shocked, of course,” Lee said after Game 4, when asked for his reaction when he got his assignment that afternoon. “But I know that I’m a reliever now.”If you like relievers, and lots of them, this has been the World Series for you. Every game has included at least 10 pitchers. Relievers have worked a staggering 63 percent of all innings (55 of 87), and no starter has pitched more than five in a game.“You can say starters are getting cut short or bullpens are getting extended,” Atlanta reliever Luke Jackson said. “It’s one of those things: Is it good for us in the bullpen? I guess. We have a job now, which is kind of cool. We’re all ready to pitch every night, whether that’s the third inning to the ninth inning.”This is not how the teams designed it. The majors’ active leaders for innings pitched, Zack Greinke and Justin Verlander, are the two highest-paid Astros. But Greinke wore down late in the season and felt tired after four innings in Game 4. Verlander is still recovering from Tommy John surgery.Houston opened the playoffs with Lance McCullers, who worked six and two-thirds stout innings to beat the Chicago White Sox in Game 1 of the division series. Then he strained his forearm in Game 4, ending his postseason.Injuries have also ravaged Atlanta’s starters. Mike Soroka, an All-Star in 2019, tore his right Achilles tendon in August 2020, and tore it again in May, nine months into his recovery. Another young starter, Huascar Ynoa, broke his pitching hand when he punched a dugout bench in May. Then he hurt his shoulder in the playoffs.And like the Astros, the Braves also lost the starter who opened their playoff run. A comebacker ricocheted off Charlie Morton’s leg in Game 1 of the World Series, and he was later found to have a broken leg. Atlanta did not exactly have Maddux in reserve. Davidson, who made four starts this season and was staying loose at the team’s Class AAA ballpark, took Morton’s roster spot.It is important to consider those factors before eulogizing the starting pitcher. Yes, the lack of durability among starters was a theme all season, with only four pitchers in the majors working 200 innings. This has been a trend for a while, but the pandemic-shortened 2020 season accelerated it. Teams were especially cautious of pushing pitchers too far, and many pitchers got hurt, anyway.The last World Series, pre-Covid, was a showcase for elite starters. That 2019 matchup, between the Astros and the Washington Nationals, included five starters who worked 200 innings that season: Greinke, Verlander and Gerrit Cole for Houston, and Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin for Washington. Strasburg even pitched into the ninth inning of Game 6.If anyone has a chance to get close to the ninth this time — or at least close to the seventh — it is Max Fried, who will start Game 6 for Atlanta. Fried lost Game 2 but was not hit hard, and he even faced two batters in the sixth inning. After patching together two bullpen games, Manager Brian Snitker should have it easier with Fried on Tuesday.“He’s ready to go,” Snitker said after Game 5. “We had him in reserve if something happened today. If we got locked up in extra innings or whatever, we were going to run him down there and possibly use him today also. I always feel good when Max pitches. He always gives you a chance to win.”Fried — who is 40-18 with a 3.34 earned run average in his career — will have an extra day of rest for Game 6. Astros Manager Dusty Baker, meanwhile, seems likely to use his Game 3 starter, Luis Garcia, on short rest. That is because Baker needed Jose Urquidy for an inning on Sunday after starter Framber Valdez fizzled out in the third.“We’re down to kind of Garcia at this point,” Baker conceded after the victory. “When you’re down 3-1, you’ve just got to kind of pull out all the stops to your rotation. If a guy’s tired, it really doesn’t matter because your next step is home, and we weren’t ready to go home. All the guys gutted it out.”Four Astros relievers have especially stood out this postseason: Ryne Stanek, Phil Maton, Kendall Graveman and Ryan Pressly. That group has combined for a 1.33 E.R.A. with 47 strikeouts in 40 ⅔ innings. For the Astros to win, they will need to keep it up.“Those four guys — I would say probably everyone in the bullpen — has been our strength this postseason,” catcher Martín Maldonado said. “They’ve been keeping us in the ballgame. They’ve been holding the lead for us. Every pitcher is different, and they attack the hitter.”A procession of low-profile, high-octane relievers on the attack is the defining image, so far, of this World Series. It is not an easy sell for baseball, and sinking TV ratings have reflected that.Baseball has tried to limit the bullpen parade with the rule that requires each pitcher to finish an inning or face at least three batters. But as long as there are so many strong relievers on postseason rosters, savvy analysts will encourage managers to chase favorable advantages. Games will continue lasting deep into the night, and the fans still watching will chug energy drinks to try to keep up.The pitching puzzle of this World Series is something of an outlier, largely a reflection of unforeseen circumstances and bad luck. But it highlights the need for teams to cultivate starters, trust them to work out of jams and keep them healthy enough to perform deep into the fall.Doing so can only help the entertainment value of baseball’s signature event — unless you happen to be a World Series reliever. If you are, style points don’t matter.“As long as we win,” said Atlanta’s closer, Will Smith, “we don’t really care.”"
78,"Facing Elimination, the Houston Astros Find Their Bats","A first-inning grand slam had Atlanta thinking championship, but the Astros kept fighting and sent the Series back to Houston for Game 6.","Published Nov. 1, 2021","ATLANTA — Adam Duvall swung and the baseball sailed high and deep and, surely, toward the history books. The 43,122 Atlanta fans filling Truist Park, early arrivals and in the mood to party with a clinching World Series win within reach, exploded into a raucous din. They believed the grand slam, only the 21st in World Series history, signaled their divine right to celebrate.It was the first inning.As Atlanta quickly found out, the Houston Astros are here for a reason, too, even if they hadn’t exhibited it much lately. But they finally found their offensive groove just when they needed it, facing elimination in Game 5. A shake-up in the lineup and a big day by a light-hitting catcher produced a series-saving 9-5 victory for the Astros.“Today really felt like the World Series because they got to go on the field and see all the people and see all the media,” Houston Manager Dusty Baker said. “It felt like the World Series, where the others felt like we were coming out of the dungeon and just going to play.“So that was big, the fact that we got to get on the field.”It had been a tough few days for the Astros. They hadn’t played in Atlanta since 2017 and, because of cold and rainy conditions, not only was their planned workout on Thursday evening canceled, but pregame on-field batting practice before Games 3 and 4 was wiped out, too. So the only time the Astros were on the unfamiliar field was during the games themselves.Offensively, it showed. They scored only two runs over the first 18 innings here, losing games 2-0 and 3-2 and having a terrible time throughout. Including the games in Houston, the Astros were 4 for 31 with runners in scoring position for this series.But Baker stubbornly said “I believe in miracles” before Game 5 and it seemed as if his team might need one as the Astros had left 17 runners on base during the first two games in Atlanta.One fact Baker cited before Game 5 was the fact that as recently as the 2016 World Series, the Chicago Cubs trailed Cleveland three games to one but came back to win the title.Houston’s offense woke up, finally, on Sunday when the skies cleared and the area dried. The Astros scheduled some early work on the field for midafternoon, before Atlanta’s batting practice session. Whether that alone brought change, or whether the Astros’ hitters are simply too good to be held down for too long, things changed dramatically in Game 5.Down by 4-0 early, Houston scratched across two runs in the second when Yuli Gurriel drove a one-out single to center, Kyle Tucker walked and Alex Bregman, struggling so badly that Baker dropped him to seventh in the lineup, knocked an R.B.I. double. Tucker then scored on catcher Martín Maldonado’s fly ball to center field.It was a beginning to some, more than that to others.“I think that was the key of us winning the game right there, bouncing back right away, those two runs,” Houston shortstop Carlos Correa said. “Bregman getting that huge double. Getting the confidence all the way up.”Bregman had gone 0 for 5 in Game 4, striking out twice and failing to hit the ball out of the infield. He is hitting only .111 (2 for 18) in this World Series even after his Game 5 double, and .171 (7 for 41) since the start of the A.L. Championship Series. Baker dropped him from third to seventh in the lineup, and Bregman was one of the Astros out early to hit on the field Sunday.“A few guys hit early who needed work,” Baker said, before flashing a knowing grin and continuing: “Like Bregman.”Scoring two runs immediately after Duvall had brought the crowd to its feet didn’t even the score quite yet, but it energized the Houston dugout.“From the moment we scored those two runs we said, ‘all right, it’s time to go. Let’s go,’” Correa said. “Let’s put great at-bats together. Let’s fight. Let’s battle.”Said Baker: “That was a shutdown inning for them, but we answered back with two and that made it a 2-0 game versus a 4-0 game.”From the Atlanta dugout, despite the sensational autumn work of his bullpen, Manager Brian Snitker was far from comfortable in the immediate aftermath of Duvall’s grand slam because “I’d rather score those runs in the seventh inning when you don’t have so much time to cover.”The Astros tied it, 4-4, with two more runs in the third. Atlanta shortstop Dansby Swanson booted a ground ball to give Houston a start there. Then the Astros shook off a Freddie Freeman homer that briefly put Atlanta on top, 5-4, by scoring three more times in the fifth. Correa and Yuli Gurriel rapped base hits, Bregman was intentionally walked and Maldonado followed by working a clutch, bases-loaded walk against Atlanta reliever A.J. Minter.Maldonado said he was expecting Bregman to get the intentional pass, and he was ready.“I wasn’t going to swing to get a strike,” Maldonado said. “It was pretty much try and be patient. I know he’s got a good cutter. He’s been amazing this year so far with that pitch. And you try to see him out for the most part.”Maldonado, the defensive stalwart at catcher who typically contributes little offensively, had drawn only one walk in 47 plate appearances this postseason at the time. But on a night when Houston was desperate for help from all corners of its roster, Maldonado stepped up. The player who finished with the worst batting average during the regular season of all big league catchers with at least 400 plate appearances (.172) finished with three RBIs the third coming on a base hit in the seventh two batters after a Bregman double.Correa chipped in an R.B.I. single in the eighth that was an unnecessary, but welcome, insurance run. It was Houston’s fifth Game 5 hit with runners in scoring position — one more than the Astros produced in the first four games combined.It all wiped out the Duvall grand slam that so many here figured was a sure sign that Atlanta was going to clinch its first World Series title since 1995. It was the first World Series grand slam in the first inning since the Yankees’ Bobby Richardson hit one in the 1960 World Series.That, and the fact that Atlanta was a perfect 7-0 at home this postseason, seemed to be premonitions for a big celebration in this town overnight Sunday. Instead, the World Series now will move back to Houston for Game 6 on Tuesday night, with the Astros’ offense showing signs of life and at least some indication that, perhaps, there may be a long way to go yet in this series."
79,"Jerry Remy, Red Sox Player and Longtime Commentator, Dies at 68","An All-Star second baseman, he spent 34 years as a broadcast analyst and was voted the first president of Red Sox Nation by fans. ","Oct. 31, 2021","Jerry Remy, the Boston Red Sox second baseman who became a fan favorite of Red Sox Nation as the team’s broadcast analyst for the last 34 years, died on Saturday. He was 68.The cause was cancer, the Red Sox said. They did not say where he died.Remy had been on leave from his color commentary post with NESN, the New England Sports Network, since early August when he underwent his seventh in a series of treatments for lung cancer, which was first diagnosed in 2008.He had spoken out against smoking.“I started smoking when I was 16 years old,” Remy said in a 2019 interview with the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. “My saying is: ‘Don’t pick up the first one because it’s really tough to put down the last one.’”Remy’s last appearance at Fenway Park was on Oct. 5 when he was driven in a cart to home plate before the American League wild-card playoff game against the Yankees and threw out the first ball.Gerald Peter Remy was born on Nov. 8, 1952, in Fall River, Mass., and grew up in nearby Somerset. He attended Roger Williams College (now Roger Williams University) in Bristol, R.I.Remy was drafted by the California Angels in 1971, joined their minor league system, played for the Angels from 1975 to 1977 and then was traded to the Red Sox and spent seven seasons with them.He was selected for the A.L. All-Star team in 1978 and finished the season with a .278 batting average and 30 stolen bases. In September 1981, he had six hits in a 20-inning game against the Seattle Mariners. He was also an outstanding defensive player.Remy retired from baseball after missing the 1985 season with a knee injury. A left-handed batter with a slight frame at 5 feet 9 inches and 165 pounds, he had a .275 career batting average with seven home runs and 208 stolen bases. But his teams never reached the postseason.Remy’s family life was marked by tragedy. In August 2013, his son Jared was arrested in the fatal stabbing of his girlfriend, Jennifer Martel. They had a daughter, Arianna Remy, who was 4 at the time. Jerry Remy said he felt “disgust and remorse,” sat out the rest of the season, and then returned to the broadcast booth in 2014.Jared Remy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and received a mandatory sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole.Jerry Remy is survived by his wife, Phoebe; their children, Jenna, Jordan and Jared; and two grandchildren.Remy was hired by NESN to broadcast Red Sox games in 1988. Known for his jocular persona, he was nicknamed RemDawg and was elected online by fans as the first president of the fan club Red Sox Nation late in the 2007 season.“When you listened to him, it was as if you were having a beer with your best friend, and his insight, humor and charm lifted your spirits,” Tom Werner, the Red Sox chairman, said.In another tribute, David Ortiz, the retired massively built slugger for the Red Sox, thanked Remy for giving him the nickname Big Papi.Remy had hoped to become a coach or to hold some other position in organized baseball after retiring as a player.“To end up in this career was never the formula,” Remy said in 2017 when he was inducted into the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame. “Then I got the job. I was scared to death. I had no idea what I was doing. And for the first two years, I would pray for rainouts because I hated myself. I mean, I could not stand myself on the air. It was horrible.“But thank goodness I stayed with it because it was one of the best things that I’ve ever done.”"
80,Saying Yes to Baseball Meant Leaving Football Behind,"Austin Riley was a quarterback and all-state punter in high school, but baseball was his true love. His breakout season helped power Atlanta’s surge to the World Series.","Published Oct. 31, 2021","ATLANTA — When Atlanta seized a three-games-to-one lead over Houston, the team had plenty of hang time while attempting to win its first World Series since 1995. So it makes sense that the team’s newest star was an all-state punter in high school.In the regular-season stretch and again in October, Austin Riley heard plenty of “M.V.P.! M.V.P.!” chants at Truist Park. It’s no wonder: In just his third major league season — and his first in which he was an everyday player for a full, 162-game year — Riley ranked second in the National League in R.B.I. (107) and total bases (313), third in hits (179), sixth in batting average (.303) and 10th in homers (33). He drove home the winning run with a single in the bottom of the ninth in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against Los Angeles and was batting .294 with three R.B.I. in the first four games of the World Series.But in Southeastern Conference country, Atlanta baseball fans starved for a title can thank the demands of high school football for pushing Riley, a slugging third baseman, toward the diamond.Riley, 24, was a quarterback as a freshman and sophomore at DeSoto Central High School in Southaven, Miss. He was also a budding baseball star. Those two paths collided when his football coach told him that he could not miss seven-on-seven summer drills after his sophomore year.“He told me, ‘We’ve got another guy here, and he’s really dedicated,’” Riley said while standing in the Atlanta dugout on Saturday. “It’s one of those things where I wanted to play quarterback but at the same time I knew I loved baseball and I wanted to pursue that.”When Riley decided not to play football, the coach invited him to stay on the team as a kicker.Sure, Riley said, why not?“I punted, did field goals, which I was terrible at,” Riley said. “I hit the upright more than I made field goals. It was kind of funny.”But, wow, could he punt. And to those who knew the family, it did not come as a surprise. His father, Mike, was a punter at Mississippi State from 1987 to 1991 and attended training camp with the Detroit Lions in 1992 and 1993.“I was in preseason camp, and both years I was there I made it to the very last cut,” Mike Riley said.Austin Riley estimated that he averaged 45 or so yards a punt in high school, and his father said the high end of his range was 75 to 80 yards. While Austin’s estimate may be generous (the MaxPreps website said he averaged 41.6 yards a punt), his father’s was spot on: His son’s longest punt was recorded as 77 yards.Father and son bonded over one of football’s more specialized skills.“We lived on some acreage,” Austin Riley said. “We had plenty of room, and there were afternoons we’d get back there and he could still spiral and turn a ball over. That’s kind of how I learned. It all started in the backyard kicking it, and I got pretty good at it.”Joining them in the yard was a cousin, Keegan James, who is now a relief pitcher in the Colorado Rockies’ organization.“All he did was long snap,” Austin Riley said. “So we’d come in, get our stuff on, do 30 minutes of practice and then bounce. ‘We’ve got to go to baseball practice.’ It was cool.”James ended up playing three years of baseball at Mississippi State. Riley committed to Mississippi State as well, with the Bulldogs offering to give him a chance to punt for the football team in addition to playing baseball. He signed with Atlanta instead, after being taken with the 41st pick in the 2015 draft.There were times when he wondered if he did the right thing. Riley struggled at the start of his professional baseball career. He reported to Atlanta’s affiliate in the Gulf Coast League, where, he said, “I think I went 0 for 21 with 14 strikeouts before I got my first hit.”His father remembered it as 0 for 24 with 17 strikeouts. Regardless, he was only 18 and it was every bit as rough as it sounds.“I’m a homebody,” he said. “We were doing all these workouts and I was like: ‘Man, I don’t even know if this is for me. Should I just go to Mississippi State and pursue professional baseball after that?’”He laughed as he remembered it: “I was getting tweeted at, ‘Austin’s going to be a pitcher by September.’ I was getting hammered. But once that first hit came, it was a domino effect.”He was called up by Atlanta in 2019, and initially played left field because the club wanted his bat in the lineup. In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, he primarily played third base. While he flashed power as a rookie, with 18 homers in 80 games, he also hit just .226. In 2020, his homer output dropped to eight in 51 games and he hit .239. It wasn’t until this summer that Riley settled in as Atlanta’s cleanup hitter.“He came up and had such a big splash and then kind of had to learn his way through the big leagues,” Atlanta shortstop Dansby Swanson said this month. “And then I feel like, in this day and age, as soon as we come up, we all have a comp, right? And we have a comp to someone of what our ceiling could be and what they were in their prime, and then when you’re not that immediately, it’s kind of like, OK, well, this person’s not any good. I feel like that happens so often in any sport nowadays.”During the N.L.C.S., Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said Riley’s maturation was really noticeable.“You see the confidence,” Roberts said. “Just at the plate, he’s handling velocity, spin. He can beat the shift, so he can control the barrel. He’s just a really good hitter. And defensively he’s gotten a couple of grades better, too.”Riley said he still talks with his mother and father at least twice a day. He married his high school girlfriend, Anna. Their support helped pull him through his rough early days in the Gulf Coast League, and now they sit in the stands at Truist Park listening to those “M.V.P.!” chants.It was just a few years ago that he was punting in the Mississippi-Alabama high school all-star game. Now he’s playing in the World Series.“This has been unreal,” Riley said, mentioning the tough, losing seasons that Atlanta institutions such as Freddie Freeman and Manager Brian Snitker worked through before his arrival. “To me, I feel like I’ve been spoiled because I’ve been in the league three years and I’m already in the World Series. A lot of people have been in the league a long time and have never been here.”There are times during the season when he will see the relievers tossing a football around in the outfield before batting practice and wonder whether he can still turn a high spiral over with a swift kick. “But I resist it because it takes just one kick and something pulls if I’m not stretched right,” Riley said.What once was an agonizing decision to give up one sport has turned out well.“I’m a people pleaser, and I loved football,” Riley said. “Friday nights, that’s what I miss most about high school. You’ve got the pregame, your little downtime. But I loved baseball more.”He said telling the football coach he was going to pursue baseball and asking Anna’s father for his blessing to marry his daughter were the two times he had been most nervous.Now?“Oh yeah,” Riley said. “I would certainly take the World Series in the misty rain to a Friday night high school football game. For sure.”"
81,Atlanta Is Peaking at Exactly the Right Time,"An 88-win team faced a series of daunting challenges, yet is on the verge of a championship thanks to timely hitting and terrific bullpen work.","Published Oct. 31, 2021","[Follow our live World Series Coverage between the Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros.]ATLANTA — In a sport that revels in the unpredictable, the Atlanta Braves were once a sure thing. With almost ruthless efficiency, they won their division 14 times in a row, a streak that began before Dansby Swanson was born and ended when he was almost a teenager.By then Swanson had charted his career path. As a boy in Marietta, Ga., he dreamed only of playing baseball — and with luck he might even do it for his favorite team. He got his wish in a surprise deal to Atlanta in 2015, just six months after the Arizona Diamondbacks had drafted him first overall out of Vanderbilt.“Getting traded here, it was probably the best thing that ever happened to me, to be able to be back home and to be able to play for this city and to just grow this community,” Swanson said late Saturday night, after his homer helped lift Atlanta to the edge of a World Series championship. “That moment, it means a lot. It really does.”Swanson’s moment arrived in the bottom of the seventh inning of Game 4 against the Houston Astros at Truist Park. He drove a fastball from Cristian Javier over the right field wall to tie the score, and Jorge Soler followed with a go-ahead pinch-hit homer, carrying Atlanta to a 3-2 victory and a three-games-to-one series lead. Atlanta can take the title at home in Game 5 on Sunday night.“I’m happy for our city that they can go through this, experience this,” Manager Brian Snitker said. “What a great time of year.”Atlanta has not been this close to the crown since 1995, the only season in that streak of division titles with a joyous ending. Winning it all can be absurdly difficult; in baseball’s modern era, the franchise triumphed once in Boston (1914) and once in Milwaukee (1957) before its lone title in Atlanta.On Saturday, Swanson and Soler pulled off a feat just as rare. Only twice before had teammates hit game-tying and go-ahead back-to-back homers in the World Series, most recently in 1981, with Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager of the Los Angeles Dodgers.Those players shared the most valuable player award for that series (with teammate Ron Cey), but Swanson did not remember their names in the interview room after Game 4. He did recall the others who did it.“Man, on MLB Network they were saying this is the third time, and the other two, one of them was Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in 1928,” Swanson said, as awe-struck as a six-year major league veteran can be.“Baseball’s been around a long time, and for this to be the third time is pretty special. I feel like when you’re in that moment and you’re in between the lines, your only thought is on winning. So it’s kind of hard to wrap your mind around what just happened.”What is happening is an 88-win team peaking at just the right time, making big plays and critical pitches that defy explanation.Atlanta’s Game 4 starter, Dylan Lee, pitched only two games in the majors this season, the same as Kyle Wright, who relieved him with one out and the bases loaded in the first inning. The Astros, with their thunderous offense, had several chances to win the game in a blowout. Instead, Wright made it through the fifth with the deficit only 2-0.“Kyle is the reason we won the game,” Snitker said, but the hitters and fielders had to do just enough to make it possible.They did, of course, because this postseason, Snitker’s team does almost nothing wrong. After doubling and scoring Atlanta’s first run in the sixth, Eddie Rosario made a racing, backhanded grab at the left field wall to rob Jose Altuve in the eighth. Unless you saw Sandy Amoros in 1955 or Joe Rudi in 1972, you’ve probably never seen a better catch by a left fielder in the World Series.“When Eddie turned to look at the fence, we thought to ourselves — or I least I thought personally — that ball either hit the fence, or it’s gone,” said Soler, describing the dugout view through an interpreter. “Then he just kept running and threw the glove out there and made the catch, and we all looked at each other in amazement, like: ‘Did that just really happen?’ It took us all by surprise, and it was something truly out of a movie.”Soler started this multipart epic with a Game 1 homer as the very first batter of the World Series. Nobody had done that before — but then, no team is believed to have lost its Game 1 starter to a broken leg in the third inning, either. That also happened to Atlanta, with Charlie Morton, and it will force Snitker to use another bullpen game to try to close out the title in Game 5.That seems daunting, but Atlanta has overcome worse problems, like the loss of their best player, Ronald Acuña Jr., to a torn anterior cruciate ligament in July. They traded for four outfielders — including Rosario and Soler — to solve that problem, and Snitker has a stable of problem-solvers in the bullpen, too.Atlanta relievers have a 1.61 earned run average across the first four games, and the Astros have been especially quiet after the fourth inning. In Atlanta’s three victories — Games 1, 3 and 4 — Houston has scored only one run from the fifth inning on.“I can’t say enough about our bullpen,” Snitker said. “My God, I’m going to talk to ownership and send them all to Hawaii for a week when we’re done.”The way things are going, there might be a parade along the way."
82,"125 Years After the First College Golf Match, a Rematch","Intercollegiate golf was born in 1896 when Yale thrashed Columbia with mashies and niblicks. Armed with titanium drivers, Columbia sought revenge.","Published Oct. 31, 2021","On a fall day in 1896, a group of Yale students, caught up in a new sports craze called golf, traveled from their New Haven, Conn., campus by train and stagecoach to a course north of New York City — one of the few clubs in the country at the time — to take on some chaps from Columbia.In what became the first intercollegiate match in the country, Yale swept Columbia, with all six golfers winning their matches.Earlier this month, after 125 years, Columbia finally got its rematch.“This is an extraordinary day for our game — the collegiate game was born 125 years ago,” Columbia’s current coach, Rich Mueller, said to the two teams gathered on the practice green of the Saint Andrew’s Golf Club in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.Yes, the first college golf match was played between two Ivy League teams that have rarely cracked the top 100 Division I schools in decades.Of course, these were different times in college sports. For decades after the first intercollegiate football game was played by Princeton and Rutgers in 1869, Ivy League football teams would remain athletic powerhouses making national headlines.Similarly, in college golf, the 1896 match signaled the beginning of Ivy dominance. The following year, the first college national championships were held, and nearly every team and individual title through 1930 was won by an Ivy League school — especially Yale, whose 21 national titles are still the most of any college.This was long before big warm-weather state schools like Houston (16 national titles) and Oklahoma State (11) enjoyed dominant eras after the N.C.A.A. took over the national championships in 1939 and became feeders for the P.G.A. Tour.The Yale men’s golf coach, Colin Sheehan, who loves his golf history, recently came across two New York Times articles from 1896 covering the Yale-Columbia match, which he promptly mentioned to Mueller.The coaches arranged a commemorative replaying of this match that became the crucible of intercollegiate golf, to get their players fired up about college golf history and traditions, and to make for some spirited competition.The original match was played on Nov. 6, 1896, at the Ardsley Casino, which had opened the previous year as one of the country’s first 18-hole courses and whose members included prominent financiers such as Jay Gould, Cornelius Vanderbilt and J. Pierpont Morgan.The club, now called the Ardsley Country Club, in nearby Dobbs Ferry, was not available to host the match this fall. And because of logistical problems with the original date, the coaches scheduled the match for Oct. 22 at Saint Andrew’s, which is Columbia’s home course and has its own place in golf history.Founded in 1888, the club claims to be the oldest continually operating golf club in the country (though several clubs make claims to various versions of this title) and is one of the five clubs that in 1894 founded the United States Golf Association.In fact, Columbia and Yale have had many rematches over the years, with Yale winning most, but both teams now largely play a tournament-only schedule instead of head-to-head matches.So they agreed to play this one as an unofficial scrimmage. Still, the importance of this momentous challenge match seemed to register with the players as they pulled up to the club not in stagecoaches but in sleek passenger vans.They filed out dressed in bright golf shirts, baseball hats and khakis or shorts — a far cry from their 1896 counterparts, who wore knickers, monogrammed blazers, tweed caps, dress shirts and bow ties.The 1896 teams played their best six players in a holes-won format, with the victor being the team with the most total holes won by all players. The coaches decided to keep that now-obscure format for the rematch and to play their full starting lineups of seven players each.An official on the first tee — Mueller’s son, Kurt, 9 — announced each twosome along with the names of the 1896 golfers who played in the respective group.In one group, William Sung, 18, a Columbia freshman, was paired against Yale’s Darren Lin, 21, a senior.Their counterparts 125 years ago were Yale’s Roderick Terry Jr. and Columbia’s G.C. Pier. Terry beat his opponent 7-0 and carded an 88, the day’s lowest score. It was also an impressive feat, given that Terry and his teammates were hitting rubberlike gutta percha balls with handmade wooden-shafted clubs that, instead of numbers, bore names like brassie, niblick, spoon and cleek.As for Lin and Sung, both grew up in California competing in junior golf tournaments and honing their swings with the help of top teaching pros, video aids and various learning tools. On the course, they use range finders that give exact yardage to a target.“It’s cool to see how far golf has come. It’s really surreal how important the technology has become,” said Sung, whose driver had a head made of aerospace titanium.In 1896, golf was just beginning to take root in the United States and had only recently “found its way among the colleges,” as a preview of the match in The Times noted.A second Times article, recapping the match, detailed how Yale blanked the fledgling Columbia squad 35-0. The victorious Yale players each received a “First Intercollegiate Golf Meet” medal.Columbia’s defeat was no shock. Located in Manhattan, Columbia had no home course and had only pulled a team together weeks before the match. Its star player, mentioned in an 1896 Columbia Spectator article as L. Tappin, was “off his game” and lost by four holes as his team was “beaten by a large score but still did not disgrace themselves.”“They were basically bringing a knife to a gunfight,” Mueller said. “You can imagine how quiet that stagecoach ride back was for Columbia.”So this time, the Columbia men were playing “with the weight of history on their shoulders,” he said.“We got such a big butt-kicking the first time around,” he said. “Some of my guys said they were never more nervous than on that first tee.”The superior Yale team grew out of an explosion in golf popularity in New Haven coupled with the 1895 opening of the New Haven Golf Club near campus.Yale had dozens of golfers on its team, and the starting six was stocked with skilled players from prominent golf families, including John Reid Jr. and F.C. Havemeyer, whose fathers helped found the U.S.G.A.Reid Jr. won his match against Columbia by 10 holes and would win the first Yale individual national title in 1898. He was the son of John Reid, a Scottish immigrant who helped found Saint Andrew’s in 1888 as a three-hole track in a cow pasture in Yonkers.The elder Reid’s old golf clubs are displayed in the John Reid Room at Saint Andrew’s in the original clubhouse where members like Andrew Carnegie and Stanford White relaxed, said Rick Powers, a member of the club’s historical committee.Ivy League athletic dominance, including golf, eventually faded as big state colleges outside of the Northeast grew in stature and the Ivies prioritized academics over athletics.“I joke that everyone on the team is here because Conrad Ray didn’t make them an offer,” Sheehan said of the men’s golf coach at Stanford, the golf powerhouse where Tiger Woods played.Yale is still a dominant force in the Ivies, and despite its unfamiliarity with Saint Andrew’s, it had its moments in the recent match. There was Ben Carpenter’s tricky up-and-down from just off the green to win the 16th hole and Lin’s back nine comeback that included a chip-in on 18 to edge out Sung, 1-0.But in the end, the day belonged to Columbia, whose 15-2 victory rubbed some balm on that 125-year-old spanking.Seeing his team rise to the historic moment, Mueller said later, was “by far the proudest moment in my 22 years of coaching.”That night, he said, he texted his players that the Columbia chaps from 1896 would be proud.“Despite the fact that they’re dead now,” he wrote, “I’m also certain that tonight they’re smiling down upon you all basking in the redemption.”"
83,Late Homers Have Atlanta on the Cusp of a Championship,"Atlanta shocked Houston with back-to-back homers in the seventh inning, putting the team one win from its first World Series title since 1995.","Published Oct. 30, 2021","[Follow our live World Series Coverage between the Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros.]ATLANTA — Dansby Swanson held his right arm in the air as he floated around the bases. Excitement had been slowly building through the night as a sleepy Atlanta Braves lineup started to wake up. But after Swanson’s game-tying home run clanked off the right field wall in the seventh inning of Game 4 of the World Series, Truist Park erupted.Moments later, Jorge Soler walloped a pinch-hit go-ahead home run just over the left field wall and the merriment doubled. Players bounced out of the home dugout. Swanson, who grew up a Braves fan outside of Atlanta, screamed, clapped and waved his arms as he watched Soler run. Eight outs away from defeat, Atlanta jumped ahead, moving within one win of a championship.“I went more nuts for that than I did for my own,” Swanson, 27, said of Soler’s blast.Trailing from the top of the first inning on Saturday, Atlanta snatched a 3-2 victory from the Houston Astros and took a three-games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven series. Atlanta entered October with the fewest wins (88) of any of the 10 teams in the playoffs. Thanks to a magical run of spirited play and a 7-0 record at home this postseason, it is now one win away from claiming its first World Series trophy since 1995.For a second straight chilly night in suburban Atlanta, the home team made the most powerful offense in baseball look feeble. On Friday, Atlanta had taken a no-hitter into the eighth inning and held Houston scoreless. A day later, Atlanta fell behind early but a cadre of pitchers did enough to keep the game close for its offense to save the day late.“I’ve always said the team that has that little boy in them that comes out are the teams that do good in the postseason,” said Atlanta Manager Brian Snitker, who added later, “The team that just plays with emotion and enjoys what they’re doing and all in the postseason are really dangerous.”Before the game, Atlanta fans were urged by the team to do the tomahawk chop, a tradition of chanting and waving that has been called offensive by several Native American groups. Among those doing it were former President Donald J. Trump and his wife, Melania. (He did it again during a sixth-inning rally by Atlanta.)In April, Trump had called for a boycott of Major League Baseball after its commissioner, Rob Manfred, moved the All-Star Game from Truist Park because of a new voting law in Georgia, which established new voting restrictions and, according to Democrats and voting rights groups that have condemned the law, unfairly targets voters of color.Atlanta’s chief executive, Terry McGuirk, recently told USA Today that Trump had called M.L.B. about wanting to attend World Series Game 4 and that the team was surprised, but it accommodated him by giving him his own suite.In a statement released on Saturday afternoon, Trump thanked Manfred and Randy Levine, the Yankees’ president, for the invitation. Later, an M.L.B. spokesman clarified, “As previously reported, President Trump requested to attend.”In all, 43,125 people packed Truist Park. They watched as both teams, with few reliable options to start Game 4, turned to pitchers with starkly different levels of experience.Houston tapped Zack Greinke, a former Cy Young Award winner with 530 career regular-season games who had been relegated to the bullpen entering the postseason because of ineffectiveness. Facing the prospect of back-to-back bullpen games, Atlanta asked the rookie Dylan Lee, who had only two regular-season relief appearances this year, to start on Saturday.Lee became the first pitcher to make his first major league start in the World Series. Unsurprisingly, he sputtered. He faced four batters, giving up a single and two walks, and notching only one out. His replacement, Kyle Wright, another pitcher who spent nearly the entire season in the minor leagues, provided a lift.Wright surrendered five hits and three walks over four and two-thirds innings but just one run. Greinke, who had thrown only four and two-thirds innings this month and no more than 37 pitches in any outing, spun four scoreless innings on 58 pitches. Both teams’ offenses struggled to convert base runners into runs, particularly Houston.“Kyle is the reason we won the game,” Snitker said. Added Wright, “I’ve had a lot of ups and downs this year. Just to be able to get back in a position where I could help the team was definitely pretty special.”Wright helped Atlanta strand seven Houston base runners through the first three innings. His lone blemish: a fourth-inning solo home run by Astros second baseman Jose Altuve that gave Houston a 2-0 lead. It moved Altuve into sole possession of second place in career postseason home runs (23). Only the former Cleveland and Boston slugger Manny Ramirez (29) has more.But as Snitker cycled through one stout reliever after another, it bought time for his team’s hitters. Said Altuve, “They have done a tremendous job. They haven’t given us many pitches to hit.”When left fielder Eddie Rosario doubled with one out in the sixth inning, it was the first time Atlanta had a runner in scoring position on Saturday. It was Rosario’s 23rd hit of this postseason.Rosario scored to halve his team’s deficit when third baseman Austin Riley singled to left field. It showed that Atlanta, a team that had already felled two National League teams with more wins (Milwaukee and Los Angeles), had more in store.“Throughout the entire postseason, going all the way back to Milwaukee, we’ve had these at-bats and these hits that have sort of electrified and surprised the entire dugout, and they’ve energized us,” said Rosario, who also robbed Altuve of an extra-base hit with a dazzling backhanded catch in the eighth inning. (“I feel right now that I’m Super Rosario,” he later added.)In the seventh inning, Atlanta electrified and surprised, again, by smashing its way into the lead. Not scored upon all postseason, Astros reliever Cristian Javier threw an 0-2 fastball over the heart of the plate to Swanson. Atlanta’s shortstop clobbered it to the opposite field for his first home run of this postseason.Born in nearby Kennesaw, Ga. and raised in Marietta, Swanson said he had thought “a million times” while growing up about hitting a home run in the World Series. He said getting traded from the Arizona Diamondbacks to Atlanta in 2015 “was probably the best thing that ever happened to me, to be able to be back home and to be able to play for this city and to just grow this community.”He credited his girlfriend, Mallory Pugh, a United States women’s national team soccer player who got to town on Friday night to see him play, with predicting he would hit a home run on Saturday.“I’ll be honest, I don’t think homer was on my mind,” he said. “I was just trying to get on base and make something happen. Thankfully, it was a homer.”One batter after Swanson, Soler, a key midseason addition, sent a pitch also down the middle over the fence and moved Atlanta one step closer to glory."
84,"With Its Battle-Tested Core Struggling, the Astros Are on the Brink","A Houston offense featuring Alex Bregman, Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa led the majors in runs and batting average. So far, Atlanta’s stellar pitching has contained them.","Published Oct. 30, 2021","[Follow our live Astros vs Braves score and coverage.]ATLANTA — The most productive offense in baseball during the 2021 regular season has gone dormant in the World Series. In the final days of October, a chill has enveloped the Houston Astros bats and expressions of frustration and confusion have clouded their faces.The Astros led majors in runs scored and batting average in the regular season — and averaged six runs per game in the American League Championship Series — but Houston is now on the brink of elimination after Atlanta won Game 4 of the World Series, 3-2, on Saturday, seizing a three-games-to-one lead.Houston’s feeble offensive numbers in the last two games, both of which were played in Atlanta, are almost baffling. The Astros have gone hitless in 10 at-bats with runners in scoring position over the last two games and have stranded 17 runners on base, including 11 in Game 4.The top five batters in the lineup — Jose Altuve, Michael Brantley, Alex Bregman, Yordan Alvarez and Carlos Correa — have combined to go 5 for 36 in those two games for a .139 batting average.In Game 3, Houston could not manage a hit until the eighth inning and finished with only two singles in a 2-0 loss.The Astros, who are playing in their third World Series in the last five years — they went to the A.L.C.S. in the other two — have certainly been in dire position before. Sometimes they made it work, like in 2017, and other times they could not. They lost the first three games of the A.L.C.S. to the Tampa Bay Rays last year, and fought back to even the series, before losing in Game 7.In the 2019 World Series, they lost the first two games at home, won the next three in Washington, but dropped the last two at home.Manager Dusty Baker said his players would rely on all of that experience, and a belief that just because the situation is dire does not mean they will acquiesce.“How small is your faith if you just crumble under every circumstance?” he said. “You’ve got to have faith that you can do it, and it will get done.”That is what it has come to for the Astros: Faith.After watching his offense stumble and falter over the last two nights in wet, cold Atlanta, it is no wonder that Baker feels he may have to lean on faith. But he also hinted that he would intercede with more practical measures, by tinkering with the lineup.“Yeah, I thought about it,” he said. “I’ll let you know tomorrow when I make the lineup out.”Bregman could slide down in the order. He has had one hit, a single through the defensive shift leading off the ninth inning in Game 3. Bregman is now 1 for 14 in the World Series after batting only .217 in the A.L.C.S.Correa hit a big home run in Game 1 of the A.L.C.S., but in the nine games since, he has gone 5 for 34 (.147) with one extra-base hit, two runs batted in and nine strikeouts. Yordan Alvarez, who was the most valuable player of the A.L.C.S., is 1 for 11.For the Astros to rebound and get the Series back to Houston, more of their best players need to start hitting better, or else their pitchers need to throw shutouts.Altuve is the first of the team’s core stars to break out of the team-wide slump. He hit a home run and a single in Game 4, his second home run of the World Series, and also had two extra-base hits taken away from him by superb defensive plays by Atlanta fielders.In the second inning, Austin Riley dove to his right for Altuve’s line drive and caught it on the foul line. And with two outs in the eighth, and the Astros trailing by a run, Eddie Rosario reached out to make a running catch of Altuve’s drive to left field.Houston had runners on base repeatedly in the first three innings, thanks in part to four bases on balls, but managed only one run in that span.If that happens again, their season could be over.“Just basically focus on one game at a time,” Altuve said. “That’s it. That’s pretty much what we talk about. If we win tomorrow, then try to win Game 6 and see what happens. But we’ve got to focus on one game, and that game is tomorrow.”"
85,A Recipe for d’Arnaud’s Perfect Day: Doughnuts and a Dinger,"Atlanta’s Travis d’Arnaud came up big, again, catching a near no-hitter and crushing a home run. A doughnut run with his family made the rest gravy.","Published Oct. 30, 2021","ATLANTA — If hitting a home run in the World Series is the stuff kids dream of growing up, then Travis d’Arnaud’s Friday was doubly good. Not only did he wallop his second home run of this Series at a key moment in the eighth inning of Game 3, but his day had started with a family trip for doughnuts.“We got 15 doughnuts,” d’Arnaud said after his 437-foot homer produced the final run to ice Atlanta’s 2-0 win. “We got a bunch of chocolate bars, chocolate twists, cinnamon twists, cinnamon rolls, apple fritter, a lot of doughnut holes.“Yeah, it was good, too.”At 32 and playing in his second World Series, d’Arnaud is in the sweet spot of his career, playing with a team he loves. Now with his fourth organization in nine years, he signed a two-year, $16 million extension in August that likely will keep him in Atlanta through 2024. He’s caught three shutouts this postseason — two against Milwaukee in a division series and Friday’s game that looked like it could be a no-hitter until pinch-hitter Aledmys Diaz dumped a base hit onto the outfield grass to start the eighth.Offensively, he is hitting .417 (5 for 12) in this World Series. An unexpected key has been using teammate Joc Pederson’s bat. After hitting .167 against the Brewers in the division series and .211 against the Dodgers in the National League Championship Series, he started using Pederson’s bat in the World Series and things turned around.“I picked it up and I said, ‘Joc, this feels pretty good,’” d’Arnaud said. “He said, ‘It’s yours, big guy.’ I said, ‘I’m going to keep using it.’”And he has, all three games.“D’Arnaud’s been a pain in our side this whole series,” Houston Manager Dusty Baker said. “And he was kind of a pain against other teams I was on.”Twice he’s been traded for pitchers who have won the Cy Young Award: He was drafted by Philadelphia but shipped to Toronto in the deal that brought the Phillies Roy Halladay in 2009. Then the Blue Jays traded him to the Mets in 2012 in a deal that sent R.A. Dickey to Toronto.General Manager Alex Anthopoulos has acquired him twice and traded him once. Anthopoulos was running the Blue Jays when they completed the Halladay and Dickey trades. He was in charge in Atlanta when he signed the catcher as a free agent after the 2019 season.“That was a fun phone call when he said, ‘Hey, we’re thinking about picking up Travis in the off-season, what do you think?” said Sal Fasano, Atlanta’s catching coach who managed d’Arnaud in Toronto’s system at Class AA New Hampshire in 2011. “And I’m like, ‘Please?’“He had a few options because he had a pretty good year with Tampa Bay. We talked on the phone a little bit and the next day he ended up signing. So it was pretty exciting.”Like many at his physically demanding position, d’Arnaud has had his share of injuries, including a sprained thumb ligament this year that sidelined him from May 2-Aug. 11. Atlanta wound up using seven different catchers to make it through the summer.“It was a grind when he was out,” Fasano said. “We were searching. When we got him back it was like having your woobie back, having your warm blanket back. Because you knew he was invested into the pitchers. He has such a nice relationship with those guys. He’s not a big rah-rah guy. He’s very calm and pretty cerebral.”Conditions during Game 3 added to the evening’s challenge. It was 49 degrees at game time and a thick mist fell off and on throughout. Though he doubled in the second, d’Arnaud struck out with the bases loaded to end the third. And he bounced to first with two on to end the fifth.Then, after his pitching staff’s attempt at a no-hitter was broken up, Jose Siri pinch-ran for Diaz, stole second and d’Arnaud was charged with an error when his throw bounced into center field, allowing Siri tp scramble to third. It was the only time Houston put a base runner on third all evening.That’s when the doughnuts came up. In the postgame interview room, he was asked about his eventful day. He said he was feeling good following the doughnut run with his wife, daughter (3) and son (two months), sounding like a man who wasn’t going to let anything, including an error, ruin his day.“There’s a lot of pressure that could come just thinking that you’re in a World Series game,” d’Arnaud said. “So I just try to stay calm and take it pitch by pitch. If I get a hit, cool. If I get an out, whatever. It’s more about catching a winner.”He did that in Game 3 to help push Atlanta to a two-games-to-one series lead. And after moving around quite a bit, he appears to have found a home for himself.“I love this city,” he said. “They’ve treated my family and me very well. I’m so thankful that I even had an opportunity to come here with Alex.”And it’s not just Anthopoulos. It’s the pitching staff he works so well with, it’s the rest of his teammates and it is a certain catching coach that has known him the longest of all of them.“Let me phrase it this way: When you have an opportunity to coach somebody in the big leagues that you helped develop, it might be one of the most warming feelings that you have as a coach,” Fasano said. “Because you saw all the hard work you put in in the younger days, and to see what he’s blossomed into, it’s pretty awesome. I know that word gets overused, but it really is pretty awesome.”"
86,"Pitching and Managing Evolve, and a No-Hit Bid Ends Early","With Ian Anderson’s pitch count rising, and the bullpen all gassed up, Manager Brian Snitker knew exactly what to do — even if a younger version of himself wouldn’t have done it.","Published Oct. 30, 2021","ATLANTA — The 1956 World Series was the first of Brian Snitker’s lifetime. Don Larsen threw a perfect game for the Yankees then, and it is one of the more indelible moments in baseball history. All these years later, no pitcher has thrown another no-hitter in the World Series.On Friday night, in Game 3 of this World Series, Ian Anderson held the Houston Astros hitless for five innings at Truist Park. Snitker, the manager of the Atlanta Braves, pulled Anderson from the game.It was not a move Casey Stengel would have made on that golden afternoon in the Bronx long ago. Then again, Snitker acknowledged, it was not a move he would have made until recently, either.“The me of old, probably a couple years ago, would be: ‘How the hell am I doing this?,’ quite honestly,” Snitker said, after a 2-0 victory that gave Atlanta a two-games-to-one lead. “But the pitch count was such that he wasn’t going nine innings.”Anderson had thrown 76 pitches, only 39 for strikes, with three walks and a hit batter in his five innings. In truth, he was less like Larsen and more like Bill Bevens, the star-crossed Yankee who issued 10 walks in Game 4 of the 1947 World Series before he lost a no-hit bid — and the game — with two outs in the ninth.Bevens’s pitch count is lost to time, but he was 30 years old and his arm never recovered; he relieved in Game 7 and then never again pitched in the majors. No modern manager would recklessly risk a pitcher’s future in pursuit of a World Series no-hitter, so Anderson never had a chance.Only three other starters had been pulled with a World Series no-hitter intact — two because of injuries (John Tudor in 1988 and David Wells in 2003), and one (Curly Ogden in 1924) because his manager essentially used him as a decoy to scramble the opposition. Anderson’s outing was the longest no-hit start in the World Series since Larsen’s.It was never going to last very long. If he had not lifted Anderson after five innings, Snitker said, he definitely would have done so after six. Atlanta’s four best relievers each had two days off, Snitker explained, and Anderson had thrown a lot of pitches to the hitters at the top of the Astros’ order, which was set to lead off the sixth.Snitker took the prevailing approach to bullpen management, in which relievers are peacekeepers more than firefighters. Why flirt with possible trouble when the starter has already done his job?“There’s a reason for it,” said Tyler Matzek, who followed A.J. Minter and Luke Jackson and lost the no-hitter on a bloop single to left by Aledmys Diaz leading off the eighth. “The guys, the front office, Snit, everybody’s gone over it a few times for what the game script is for us to win this thing. Obviously, the game script is right.”The beauty of sports, of course, is that there actually is no script; the performers try to carry out the manager’s plan as an opponent tries to foil it. There is always a chance that a pitcher will be better than his team could have expected. When that happens in a setting like the World Series, fans want to believe they might see another Larsen.Who could forget the letdown in Game 6 of the World Series last fall, when Tampa Bay Rays Manager Kevin Cash pulled Blake Snell from a shutout in the sixth inning while facing elimination? Snell had utterly dominated the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were thrilled to see him leave for a tired reliever, Nick Anderson. The Dodgers promptly stormed ahead and won the title.In that case, though, Cash’s flaw was trusting the wrong reliever: Nick Anderson had been struggling, and the Dodgers were eager to see him. The Astros were not as thrilled to see Ian Anderson depart, because they knew Atlanta’s bullpen would be just as stingy.“They have a really good pitching staff all the way around,” said Alex Bregman, who rolled a single against the shift off Will Smith in the ninth. “No matter who’s coming in, you’ve got to stay focused and locked in.”Especially when those pitchers are Minter, Jackson, Matzek and Smith. Jackson looks sharp again after a rough National League Championship Series, and the other three have been overpowering throughout the postseason, with a combined 1.10 earned run average and 43 strikeouts in 32 ⅔ innings.Anderson, 23, took a no-hitter into the sixth inning of his major league debut against the Yankees last August. But he said he could not remember ever throwing a complete-game no-hitter, even in high school in Clifton Park, N.Y. He wanted to keep pitching on Friday, but conceded he could not challenge Snitker’s logic.“I knew he wasn’t going to budge,” Anderson said. “It’s hard to. You’ve got guys like Matzek and Minter and Luke and Will at the back end coming in, you can’t blame him for going to those guys. Those guys, time in and time out, get it done.”Starters have been working less and less this October, which stands to reason at the end of a long season following a very short one. But what we saw in Game 3 was mostly about the evolution of pitching.Technology helps coaches identify the right areas of emphasis for each pitcher. Armed with the knowledge of what they should use and why, more pitchers than ever have the stuff to overwhelm hitters for short bursts. The best teams, like Atlanta, have lots of those pitchers.Ten or so years ago — or, say, in 1956 — a starter was probably the manager’s best option deep into the game. Now he may not be, even if he has not allowed a single hit.“I don’t know,” Snitker said, almost apologetically. “It’s just that we had all our guys gassed up today. I kind of liked how it set up.”It set up Atlanta with a lead in the World Series, and that — more than matching milestones from decades ago — is all that really mattered."
87,Atlanta Flirts With a No-Hitter and Takes Series Lead,"After the team honored Hank Aaron, Atlanta’s pitchers baffled Houston’s offense, holding the powerful Astros hitless through seven innings.","Published Oct. 29, 2021","[Follow our live World Series Coverage between the Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros.]ATLANTA — There are plenty of ways to win a game in the World Series.Atlanta, on Friday night, found this peculiar one: Start with an “effectively wild” starting pitcher, and add an offense that mustered a lone run in an inning that featured seven batters. Finish things off with a bullpen that nearly pulled off a combined no-hitter and slammed the door regardless. A late home run for insurance purposes did not hurt.But Atlanta did not need the insurance. The Braves won, 2-0, to maneuver around the Houston Astros in Game 3 of the World Series, taking a lead of two games to one in the best-of-seven showdown.On a stage where the franchise had not hosted since 1999, and on a night that began with a poignant tribute to Hank Aaron, Atlanta summoned an unorthodox showing of pitching mastery to keep a potent offense largely moribund — in spite of a blur of balls and hit batsmen.Starter Ian Anderson threw five innings without permitting a hit. Then came A.J. Minter, whose inning of work kept Houston’s bats similarly silenced. Luke Jackson needed 11 pitches to retire the Astros in order in the seventh. And although Tyler Matzek allowed an eighth-inning flare of a single to Aledmys Díaz, who was in the game as a pinch-hitter, ending Atlanta’s quest for the first combined no-hitter in World Series history, he ultimately extinguished Houston’s hopes of evening the score then.Will Smith, the Atlanta closer, surrendered a single to start the ninth but stymied the next three Astros.All told, Atlanta walked three Astros batters and hit two. Its staff threw as many pitches — 133 — as Houston, but six fewer strikes. And Dusty Baker, the manager of the Astros, said that Anderson’s “effectively wild” outing had kept Houston off-balance.“Our guys never could zero in on the strikes,” Baker said. “It’s no secret they’ve got a good bullpen, so we didn’t center too many balls tonight. We threatened a couple times and didn’t get the two-out R.B.I. hits we’d gotten before, and it was kind of an uneventful night for us.”Even though Atlanta won, and even if Atlanta goes on to win the World Series for the first time since 1995, its decision to pull Anderson after five no-hit innings and 76 pitches is virtually certain to live on for debate.“I thought there was a chance that I could stay in,” Anderson said, “but I think, when you have a chance to get to those guys at the back end, you can’t hesitate.”Atlanta’s manager, Brian Snitker, acknowledged that his strategy “could have backfired, I guess.”But he also said he had concluded that, in a World Series game with a lead, Anderson had achieved all that Atlanta could reasonably demand.At that point, though, Snitker’s club was operating under the narrowest of scoreboard advantages.Atlanta’s offensive outburst, if it could be called that, began when Eddie Rosario, a recurring star of the team’s postseason run, led off the third inning and turned a six-pitch at-bat into a walk. Freddie Freeman followed with a single into left-center.Luis Garcia’s strikeout of Ozzie Albies left Atlanta with runners on first and second with one out as Austin Riley sauntered to the plate, provoking the cheers that have followed him here throughout the playoffs: “M.V.P.! M.V.P.! M.V.P.!”Riley swung at a cutter and missed. Garcia decided to place the same bet again.It failed. Riley swung at the cutter and struck it with just enough zip down the third-base line, just beyond the diving reach of Alex Bregman. Rosario dashed home as Freeman came to a stop at third and Riley headed toward second.An eruption, the same kind that had put Game 1 away early, seemed imminent, maybe even probable, particularly when Jorge Soler walked to load the bases with a lone out.But Adam Duvall popped out to first, and Travis d’Arnaud was unable to stop his bat on a 2-2 pitch, striking out on a checked swing.Houston lurked in the fourth, after Anderson walked Yordan Álvarez and hit Carlos Correa with a four-seam fastball that ripped in at 94 miles an hour.The Astros never had two men aboard at once again, though Jose Siri, running for Díaz in the eighth, reached third on a stolen base and a throwing error that left the ball bouncing into center field. Matzek, though, promptly forced a fly ball off the bat of Michael Brantley to end the threat.In the bottom half of the eighth, Houston’s Kendall Graveman picked up two quick outs before d’Arnaud, perhaps looking for a measure of atonement after cutting Atlanta’s third-inning would-be rally short, stepped into the batter’s box.Graveman fired a sinker as his first offering to d’Arnaud, who hit it 437 feet into the stands in center.And the strong showing by Garcia, who had exited with two outs in the fourth inning and allowed one run on three hits, was further squandered.“I think we didn’t swing it for one game,” Bregman said. “I think we flush it and move on to the next day and have a short memory. You have to in this game.”Game 4 is scheduled for Saturday night in Atlanta, and Game 5 for Sunday. If Atlanta loses either, the series will return to Houston on Tuesday, just a few days after one chance for history fell away late.Not, Atlanta’s players insisted, that it bothered them all that much.“The goal of every game is to get a win,” d’Arnaud said. “I think a no-hitter would have been a bonus, but when they got that hit, that wasn’t our goal when the game started. It was just to go out there, execute pitches, get outs, and end with a win. That’s ultimately what we did.”"
88,"At World Series, Atlanta Finally Gets Its Tribute to Hank Aaron","A video tribute, a standing ovation to his widow and a first pitch thrown by his son highlighted a pregame ceremony.","Oct. 29, 2021","ATLANTA — A few moments after fans at Truist Park did their customary tomahawk chop chant, which many see as a racist gesture that insults Indigenous people, they gave a standing ovation to Billye Aaron, the widow of Hank Aaron, during a pregame tribute to the Hall of Fame player who died in January.Aaron’s courageous pursuit of Babe Ruth’s career home run record in the face of racist abuse made him a pioneering symbol of progress for many Black Americans. His death unleashed an outpouring of love and tributes throughout baseball and the country.(Atlanta originally hoped to honor Aaron at the All-Star Game in July, but Major League Baseball moved the game to Denver as a protest against a Georgia law that established new voting restrictions and that, according to Democrats and voting rights groups that have condemned the law, unfairly targets voters of color.)All season, the outfield at Truist Park featured a giant No. 44, Aaron’s jersey number, painted into the grass. When Atlanta won the National League pennant this month, the team and M.L.B. decided to finally honor Aaron in front of a national television audience, ahead of the team’s first home World Series game, which was Friday’s Game 3.“I think that us players in that clubhouse kind of felt like we needed to do something so that his life could be celebrated in some way on the biggest stage,” said Tyler Matzek, the relief pitcher for Atlanta. “It’s a little extra motivation just to go out there and show what the Braves are all about, and he was what the Braves were all about”The ceremony included a video tribute that was shown in the stadium and on the Fox national broadcast. It included descriptions of Aaron’s role in helping to further integrate baseball after he joined Milwaukee in 1954 — seven years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier — and the significance of the home run chase when he passed Ruth in 1974. It also mentioned his impact as a role model for millions of Americans.Billye Aaron stood on a round red carpet on the side of the field and waved to the fans as they cheered her, and then Dusty Baker, the Houston Astros manager who was a close friend of Aaron, emerged from the visitors’ dugout and jogged to the mound, where he greeted three of Aaron’s children, Hank, Jr. Gaile and Dorinda, and a grandson, Raynal Aaron.Brian Snitker, the Atlanta manager, was overcome by the emotion of the moment when discussing the ceremony after Atlanta’s 2-0 win. Aaron had hired Snitker to be a coach in the minor leagues when Aaron was Atlanta’s farm director and he helped guide Snitker’s post-playing career. The two grew very close.“I got to hug Billye,” Snitker said, and then paused for several seconds, apparently holding back tears, before he continued, “and tell her how much I missed Hank.”Aaron was also a mentor to Baker, who joined Atlanta as a rookie in 1968 and played seven years with Aaron — he was the on-deck batter when Aaron hit his 715th home run on April 8, 1974. They remained very close friends and Baker often cites advice Aaron gave him and other teammates. Before the game, Baker noted that it was a strange, somber experience for him to come to Atlanta and not see Aaron there.“This is the most different kind of feeling that I’ve had, that you can’t describe,” Baker said, “because I’m happy to be back here, but I’m sad to be back here for the first time — other than Hank’s funeral — without Hank.”Baker gave each of Aaron’s children a hug on the mound, and then Hank Aaron Jr. threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Atlanta’s star first baseman, Freddie Freeman, who said before the game that he had chills thinking of what the ceremony would be like.“Whoever came in contact with him, he made you feel love,” Freeman said. “I wish he was here to be able to watch this.”The tribute was brief, in part because team and M.L.B. organizers said they believed that Aaron, a modest and understated superstar, would have wanted the focus to be on the players and the game and not on him.But it was important that the greatest player in franchise history, and one of the transcendent athletes in history, received the recognition.“It’s totally necessary,” Baker said. “This is the year of Hank Aaron.”"
89,Atlanta’s Sidelined Superstar Can Picture Himself Out There,"Ronald Acuña Jr. is disappointed that an injury has kept him out of the World Series. But, the All-Star outfielder said, “it’s my turn to be on the bench supporting my teammates.”","Oct. 29, 2021","HOUSTON — As Atlanta Braves outfielder Jorge Soler stepped into the batter’s box on Tuesday for the first at-bat of the 2021 World Series, one of his teammates sitting in the dugout pretended he was up there instead. It’s not that outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. wants to take Soler’s job; it’s that he misses doing his.“In all of the moments, even in the key ones, I’m imagining myself there taking that at-bat,” Acuña said in Spanish on Wednesday before Game 2 against the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park.In reaching the World Series for the first time since 1999, Atlanta overcame a major obstacle: the absence of their best player.Acuña, 23, is a dazzling performer on the field, one of the very best in the entire sport. He can run fast, hit balls hard and throw with accuracy. He won the 2018 National League Rookie of the Year Award. The two-time All-Star was playing like a candidate for the Most Valuable Player Award — .283 average, .990 on-base-plus-slugging-percentage, 24 home runs, 17 stolen bases — before his season ended abruptly on July 10.While running after a fly ball against the Marlins in Miami, Acuña made a leaping attempt and landed on his right leg. His knee buckled and he tumbled into the outfield wall. The damage was substantial: a torn anterior cruciate ligament, which required surgery and is normally followed by eight to 12 months of recovery.That might have been the most pivotal day of an eventful season for Atlanta. Because of Acuña’s injury, General Manager Alex Anthopoulos went on a trading spree to bolster the outfield. Eddie Rosario, Joc Pederson, Jorge Soler and Adam Duvall were all brought in. And Anthopoulos’s gambles paid off as the players acquired helped power the team to the World Series.The four new outfielders were asked to fill in for Acuña as well as Marcell Ozuna, a former All-Star who is on administrative leave while being investigated by Major League Baseball for domestic violence. Collectively, they are hitting .289 with nine home runs and 28 R.B.I. entering Friday. Rosario was the most valuable player of the National League Championship Series and Soler homered in the first at-bat of the World Series.“Spectacular — they’re doing an incredible job,” said Acuña, who is signed to an eight-year $100 million deal through 2026. “They’ve helped the team and that’s what we needed the most.”Freddie Freeman, a star first baseman, added: “It’s pretty amazing that we tried to cover with four guys to pick up Ronald’s performance. I think we were able to accomplish that, even though we want Ronald here.”Watching them succeed, though, has a bittersweet undertone for Acuña. After helping the team win its fourth straight N.L. East division title, he wants nothing more right now than to be playing alongside his teammates. He initially planned to settle for the next best option: joining them in the clubhouse and dugout for home games at Truist Park.But when the 88-win Atlanta reached the N.L.C.S. against the 106-win Los Angeles Dodgers, Acuña asked the team’s athletic trainers whether he could travel for the World Series should they advance. They needed to sign off, he said, because they are very cautious with him and want him to avoid any potentially harmful movement.“It’s a dream to go to the World Series,” he said, adding later: “I always love being with my teammates. I live more with them than with my real family. This is also my family, so I told them that I want to be with the team as far as we go.”For Atlanta Manager Brian Snitker, it was a no-brainer to bring Acuña to the World Series, along with other crucial players who were injured, including starter Mike Soroka (re-torn Achilles tendon) and catcher Stephen Vogt (sports hernia surgery).“I’m really glad these guys can be here to experience this with their teammates,” Snitker said. “Ronald had a big hand in this until he was hurt. I want them to experience it, because they are part of this club.”Although he would have much preferred Acuña be on the field, Snitker said Acuña’s trip to the World Series was still valuable. Snitker added, “I want you to remember that feeling when we get to spring training, how hard it is to get here, how hard you have to work and be consistent every day in order to put yourself in this position.”Watching an entire game from the dugout is a new experience for Acuña, who noted that this was the most significant injury of his career. Known for his vibrant playing style and personal flair, Acuña has channeled that into cheerleading from the dugout — while donning his playing uniform. He constantly talks to and pumps up his teammates.When catcher Travis d’Arnaud smashed a solo home run in a 7-2 loss in Game 2 that tied the best-of-seven series at one game apiece, Acuña waved his arms and smacked the dugout railing with glee. One of Acuña’s closest friends on the team, the star second baseman Ozzie Albies, recently said Acuña had offered words of encouragement throughout the playoffs, including reminders of how much he wants them to win a title this year. It would be the franchise’s first since 1995.“It feels weird,” Acuña said of not playing. “I feel like totally upset because I’m part of this team and I would love to be out there playing and giving my best and my 100 percent. But God’s time is perfect, and it’s my turn to be on the bench supporting my teammates.”It is also, of course, his turn to get healthy. For the first month and a half after surgery, Acuña said he wondered whether he would ever walk or run again because his leg felt so weak. But now, he happily reported that he was showing progress.He doesn’t need crutches anymore, nor does he have a noticeable limp. He spends roughly three and a half hours a day in rehabilitation, he said, and he is using weights to strengthen his leg little by little. And soon, he said, he will start swinging a bat and loosening his throwing arm. The rough estimate for his return is early next season, in May.“If it was up to me, I’ll be back sooner,” Acuña said. “But I’m not in a rush. I have to do everything calmly because it’s my knee and it’s the support of the entire body. When I feel good, I’ll be back.”As Acuña walked through the tunnel connecting the visitor’s dugout at Minute Maid Park to the clubhouse on Wednesday, he was enveloped in a hug. It was from Ralph Garr, 75, the former Atlanta star outfielder who serves as a special assignment scout for the team.“I love you to death,” he told Acuña. “How you doing? You got them playing good.”Acuña laughed. Earlier, he admitted that he was already imagining the team back in the World Series next year — “but with me playing this time.”"
90,Batting Ninth for One More Weekend: The Pitcher,"With baseball veering toward a universal designated hitter, Sunday’s Game 5 of the World Series could be the last time pitchers routinely take turns at the plate.","Published Oct. 29, 2021","ATLANTA — You could just about hear Tom Glavine’s familiar grimace through the telephone.After generations of arguing and bickering and purity testing, this Sunday, he knew, might be the end of pitchers routinely hitting (or trying to) in Major League Baseball.“Take the brutality, so to speak, of what pitcher hitting has become, and I still feel like it allows for way more strategy in the National League,” Glavine, a Hall of Fame left-hander who hit .203 or better in nine of his 22 seasons, lamented. “I’m hoping that that part of the argument will certainly be a strong one, but it seems now that there’s more momentum than ever to get rid of it.”Whether pitchers’ plate appearances are a righteous tradition or a time-honored, time-wasting embarrassment, they could largely vanish by 2022’s Opening Day. Baseball’s next collective bargaining agreement is still being negotiated, and one major change being considered is the adoption of a universal designated hitter. If that happens, Game 5 of this year’s World Series, which Atlanta will host in its National League stadium on Sunday night, would be the last time pitchers were compelled by rule to bat.“I really enjoy hitting, but it’s good for the game,” Max Fried, an Atlanta pitcher and a finalist for one of this year’s Silver Slugger Awards, said of the potential rule change.“At the end of the day, for me to go out and hit every five days, or be a pitcher that’s hitting, it’s not as good as having a guy whose job is to hit,” said Fried, who hit .273 this season. “I understand it, but I will miss it — extremely.”Another star of Atlanta’s rotation, Charlie Morton, said he would not miss hitting: “I actively try not to think about it even now.”Pitchers would still be allowed to hit in an era of a universal D.H. Most, though, would not if a bit of baseball’s past is left on the bargaining table and the American and National Leagues permanently align on the matter for the first time in almost a half-century. (Baseball temporarily adopted a universal D.H. for the pandemic-disrupted 2020 season.)The designated hitter rule was conceived as a way to dial up offense after years of dismal hitting and, in turn, generate more money and interest in the sport. The American League adopted the D.H. in 1973, in what was designed as a three-season experiment. The National League’s disdain was evident from the start. “We like the game the way it is,” Charles S. Feeney, the N.L. president, said at the time. It never adopted the rule.But the A.L. has bested the N.L. in batting average ever since, including by 15 points in 1989 and 1996. The gap has been far narrower in some recent seasons, like a 3-point margin this year, when, at .244, the M.L.B. average tied its fifth-lowest mark since 1871.The decades since the dawn of the D.H. also have seen pitching emerge as even more of a discipline, and drawn increased attention to the risks that pitchers face whenever they step into the batter’s box or wind up on the basepaths. And so even some N.L. stalwarts have started to stray from their historically party-line opposition.“For every Adam Wainwright, there’s 10 guys that can’t hit,” Atlanta Manager Brian Snitker said, referring to the St. Louis pitcher who has driven in a comparatively impressive 75 runs in his 16 big league seasons. “They don’t hit anymore at a young age, they’re specializing in pitching or whatever at a young age, so after experiencing it last year, I’m all for the D.H.”Of course, there are exceptions.Shohei Ohtani reached the All-Star Game this year as both a pitcher and a D.H. The breakout star for the Los Angeles Angels hit 46 home runs and a major league-leading eight triples, while posting a 9-2 record as a pitcher with 156 strikeouts and an E.R.A. of 3.18.While not coming close to matching Ohtani’s mastery at the plate, others have at least shown some occasional pop. Madison Bumgarner, the Arizona pitcher, has 109 hits, including 19 home runs, across his 13 seasons, and Jake Arrieta, of the Cubs, has homered six times in his career, including once off Bumgarner in a playoff game.For the most part, though, National League pitchers come to the plate, see a few pitches and sometimes feebly swing at them. That bothers people like Glavine, who prided themselves on forcing opponents to reckon with them as more than easy outs.“I’m not going to sit here and tell you I was a great hitter, but as a pitcher, I was certainly a good hitter, and I felt like my ability to do that was an advantage every time I went out on the mound,” Glavine said. “I wasn’t necessarily going to get an R.B.I. base hit or whatever, but I knew two things: No. 1, if I had to bunt, I was going to get the bunt down, and No. 2, I wasn’t going to be an automatic out.”Or, as Clayton Kershaw, the Los Angeles ace who once pitched a complete-game shutout and hit the afternoon’s winning home run, put it: “Baseball is a two-sided game, offense and defense. I think you should have to play both even if you’re not good at one.”Kershaw finds himself intrigued by the so-called double-hook rule, which would force a team to forfeit its D.H. once its starting pitcher leaves the game, thus offering an incentive to emphasize starters rather than relievers. It is not clear whether the major leagues, which watched with interest while the independent Atlantic League tested the approach this year, would include such a provision in a rewritten rule book.Morton, a postseason stalwart who left Game 1 with a broken leg, argues that most modern pitchers simply have no place in the batting order.“I’m always late to the on-deck circle, just because I need to unplug for a minute, and I like to worry about the job that I have to do on the mound,” Morton said before a National League Championship Series game. “That’s what I’m paid to do, that’s what I’m prepared to do, spend the vast majority of my time doing. They’re paying guys lots of money and guys are working their tails off trying to be good hitters, and I’m up there taking at-bats.”Plus, he said, he doesn’t love pitching to pitchers.“It’s a lose-lose situation to me because they’re not supposed to get a hit,” said Morton, whose 2016 season ended when he tore his hamstring while running to first base after a bunt.Morton is on course to get his wish.And while the game’s elder statesmen might object to the change, and players like Bumgarner may lobby to continue to hit for themselves, at least one reliever contends he has something to gain from losing the expectation that he might be asked to bat.Will Smith has been around the N.L. since 2014 but his lone official at-bat came in 2019, when he was with the Giants. With runners on second and third, Smith, now Atlanta’s closer, lashed a 3-1 fastball to right field for a two-run single.Never mind that Bryce Harper nearly threw him out at first.“I finished with a 1.000 career batting average, so I’m OK with that,” he said."
91,"Stripped of the All-Star Game, Atlanta Hopes to Make Up for Lost Time",A tribute to Hank Aaron will kick off the World Series in a city and region still resentful of M.L.B.’s decision to step into the political fray.,,"ATLANTA — Truist Park, the home of the Atlanta Braves, was shoved aside by Major League Baseball in April when the league stripped the team of its chance to host the All-Star Game and garner the attention and money the event provides.In a decision that inspired a great deal of debate, M.L.B. moved the game to Denver to signal the league’s opposition to Georgia’s new election law that limits voting and, according to Democrats and voting rights groups that have condemned the law, unfairly targets voters of color. The team was bitterly disappointed by the move and said so in a rare statement that took issue with the league’s decision.But fate forced all of baseball back to Atlanta, not for the All-Star Game, but for the World Series, much to the delight of the team — and some local residents and politicians who resented M.L.B.’s delving into the political fray.That group includes David Ralston, the speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, who is a Republican and was critical of M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred for calling off a game that was years in the making.“I’m not going to sit here and tell you that I didn’t think about that,” Ralston said in a telephone interview this week.Ashley Barnes, a post office employee who lives only a few blocks from the stadium, is an ardent Braves fan, but applauded M.L.B.’s decision to move the All-Star Game. Barnes, who is African American, said that Atlanta making the World Series was a fair return for the sacrifice of having lost the All-Star Game.“I think it all worked out great,” she said while holding a Braves flag she had just purchased for her apartment. “It was the right thing then, and it’s the right thing now. This is big for the Braves and Atlanta.”The team itself is not gloating publicly about the circumstances, but it is overjoyed to have a second chance at something special that was lost because of the cancellation — a tribute to Hank Aaron in front of a large, international television audience.The team intended a ceremony to honor the Hall of Famer and longtime Brave, who died in January and was a part of the organization for decades. Part of the unintended fallout of M.L.B.’s decision was that Aaron, a transcendent athlete who dealt with intense racism during his pursuit of Babe Ruth’s home run record, was not given his due.Now that Atlanta is in the World Series, that perceived wrong can be corrected.Just moments before the first pitch of Game 3 of the World Series, at Truist Park on Friday night, the team will finally honor Aaron in front of roughly 40,000 fans and a national television audience of millions. The ceremony is expected to be brief because organizers believe the understated Aaron would have objected to any lavish presentation.But in conjunction with M.L.B. and Fox, the broadcaster of the game, the ceremony will include a video tribute that will be aired on the broadcast, close enough to the first pitch that it will captured by a large audience, unlike many pregame ceremonies that are not aired publicly.Aaron’s widow, Billye Aaron, is expected to be at the game and will be briefly highlighted. One or more of Aaron’s family members will throw out the ceremonial first pitch.M.L.B. did honor Aaron at the All-Star Game in Denver, but for some that was inadequate.“The celebration in Denver, it was disconnected from reality,” Ralston said. “Aaron never played there; he played in Milwaukee and he played in Atlanta. So, I’m happy that there will be a tribute paid to him in Atlanta. He was a very, very deserving guy who added so much to the game of baseball, so much to the city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia.”For some, those words would ring hollow considering Ralston’s support for the voting law, which he claims was misinterpreted by M.L.B. and other critics.But for others, each provision of the law is intended to disenfranchise Black and Democratic voters by limiting ballot access in large urban and suburban counties that are home to many of them. It also cuts in half the amount of time available to request an absentee ballot. In the last election, 26 percent of the Georgia electorate used absentee ballots and 65 percent of those voted for President Biden.One provision makes it a crime to offer water to voters waiting in lines, which tend to be longer in densely populated precincts.M.L.B. took the stance that the law was discriminatory and limited fair access to voting, leading to its decision to wade into the political landscape.“We always have tried to be apolitical,” Manfred said Tuesday before Game 1 of the World Series in Houston. “Obviously, there was a notable exception this year. I think our desire is to try to avoid another exception to that general rule. We have a fan base that’s diverse, has different points of view, and we’d like to keep the focus on the field on the game.”That will be doubly challenging in Atlanta because of the team name and its fans’ persistent use of the “tomahawk chop” chant, which many consider racist and insensitive to Indigenous people. Adding to the charged atmosphere, former President Donald J. Trump is expected to attend Game 4 on Saturday.Manfred was asked if it is possible, in today’s political climate, to avoid taking sides.“It’s harder than it used to be,” he said.But Aaron the ballplayer is a unifying figure. Those who walk in and around Atlanta’s stadium see his image and name every few feet, and he was beloved in the region.He originally signed with the Braves when they were in Boston but did not play for the team until it moved to Milwaukee in 1954. He then moved with the franchise to Atlanta in 1966, and in 1974 he broke Babe Ruth’s career home run record of 714, despite enduring horrendous racist abuse during the chase.He finished his career back in Milwaukee, with the Brewers, and ended with 755 home runs, a record that stood until Barry Bonds broke Aaron’s record and finished with 762.Atlanta’s remarkable run to this year’s World Series is, in a way, the team’s own tribute to Aaron. First the team beat Milwaukee in the division series and now is facing the Astros, who are managed by Dusty Baker, Aaron’s protégé and lifelong friend. Baker often cites Aaron’s influence on him and generations of players of all races.“I think Hank gets a bad rap of being angry or being this or that,” Baker said. “He had reason to be, but Hank was as good to Latin guys as he was to white guys as he was to Black guys. Hank, he was like a father to a lot of people.”That, most everyone agrees, is worth honoring."
92,M.L.B. Commissioner Can’t Hear Native Voices Over Atlanta’s Chop,"Asked about the Atlanta team’s longstanding use of a faux war chant, Rob Manfred claimed Native Americans in the area are “wholly supportive” of it. That’s not what our columnist found.","Published Oct. 29, 2021","[Follow our live World Series Coverage between the Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros.]It’s 2021, and we still see fans doing tomahawk chops at sporting events and hear cringe-worthy faux war chants straight out of a spaghetti western.We still have team names and imagery that mock Native Americans.We still must confront this spectacle of ignorance on the biggest stages, including this week in the World Series.High schools and colleges long ago began moving away from symbolism and gestures caricaturing Native Americans. In professional sports, the N.F.L. franchise in the nation’s capital, bowing to pressure from corporate sponsors, became the Washington Football Team, jettisoning the slur it was known by. The Cleveland Indians will soon become the Guardians.The Atlanta Braves did not get the memo.When the Houston Astros play Atlanta in Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, racist iconography will be on full display. We will see a field full of athletes playing for an Atlanta team named after people who suffered through genocide and land theft, and still sit at the margins of society today.Time after time, 41,000 fans, most of them white, will rise and wave their arms in a chopping motion while whooping a faux Native battle cry.The team primed this behavior for years. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the franchise had a mascot named Chief Noc-A-Homa prance around. He had a sidekick: Princess Win-A-Lotta. (I kid you not.) Though the team’s practice of doling out foam tomahawks has faded, the club still goads fans to whoop with the sounds of a beating drum.Major League Baseball and its commissioner, Rob Manfred, have done little to discourage the archaic mockery, either. Though Manfred hailed the Cleveland team for its steady stripping away of offensive rituals and for changing its nickname to the Guardians, when asked by a reporter this week about the derogatory team name and celebrations in Atlanta, the commissioner immediately obfuscated.Manfred claimed that each of the league’s teams must be treated differently because baseball is a regional game, even though he was kicking off a nationally televised event called the World Series.Native Americans in the area are “wholly supportive of the Braves program, including the chop,” Manfred claimed, pointing to outreach the club has made to tribes in the region.It took me less than a day to find just such a network of Native Americans, who are unwilling to back the team’s mascot or related traditions.“The commissioner is playing fast and loose with the term ‘wholly,’” said Jakeli Swimmer, a 31-year-old graduate student and a member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, a tribe of roughly 16,000 with Georgia roots whose leadership has a partnership with the Braves. “He is using our tribe as an excuse and a cover. He is saying things without taking the time to understand that there are plenty of us who oppose what that team is doing.”“I am totally against the Atlanta Braves name, the mascot and the tomahawk chop,” said Missy Crow, 59, a community organizer who lives on tribal land, a hilly, river-crossed countryside near the Smoky Mountains. “This is cultural appropriation and a mocking slap in the face.”“We are not a monolith,” said Natalie Welch, an assistant professor at Linfield University in Oregon who grew up in the Eastern Band’s tribal territory. She explained that groups of people far from power, who are virtually invisible in dominant culture, sometimes allow themselves to be used as tokens — even if it means going against the group’s interests in exchange for validation. “You become willing to take scraps, just to be seen.”To Welch, that’s a big part of why some tribal members lend their credibility to a billion-dollar franchise. She said there is also a large swath of members who are indifferent.“Then there are people like me,” she said. “We’re saying what the Braves do is humiliating. It makes it easier for our communities to be marginalized, traumatized and objectified.”Welch’s evolution on the subject embodies its nuance. Like many Native Americans, she did not think twice about her love for the Washington Football Team and Atlanta’s pro baseball team when she was growing up. It was a family thing, and she knew many families who felt similarly.But then she became one of the few who left the tribe’s land, headed off to college and did not come back. From the outside, she saw things differently. Now she adamantly opposes the fake chants and the cartoonish team names and mascots at every level of sports.Some Native American schools use the imagery, a relic of early 20th century efforts to assimilate. Welch graduated from Cherokee High, which uses “Braves” as its nickname. She wants that moniker gone from her school, too. The Eastern Band’s leadership has taken a different tack.The tribal chief, Richard Sneed, helped orchestrate a cultural partnership with the M.L.B. team after it reached out three years ago, he said.The tribe’s casino has long been a corporate sponsor of the team, and the cultural partnership, he said, brings the tribe extra publicity. He added that the team had produced a video telling the Eastern Band’s story and had contributed roughly $30,000 to the tribe.Sneed has no issue with the name, seeing it as a reflection of strength, but he rolls his eyes at the chop. “I don’t necessarily have an issue with people swinging their arm, but the whole war chant, that’s hokey,” he said. “I told them, man, that’s like 1940s, 1950s spaghetti western stuff.”Did Sneed ever prod the team to change? Never, he said.The Eastern Band maintains deep ties to Georgia even though the tribe was driven from the state in the 19th century. It is part of the Cherokee Nation, which, along with the Muscogee Nation, has expressed adamant opposition to the team’s tired act.“The caricature and appropriation of a race of people, we want it stopped,” said Jason Salsman, a spokesman for the Muscogee.Those tribes are not alone. The Cleveland franchise decided, in part, to change its name after consulting with Stephanie Fryberg, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and a member of the Tulalip nation in Washington State. Her recent polling showed that up to 75 percent of Native Americans oppose symbols of Indigenous people in sports, with the number shooting higher among younger age groups.Symbolism and sports are a potent mix. Think of the ardent, practically religious devotion many fans have simply for the insignia of their favorite team. Think of how images of a Black quarterback kneeling during the national anthem set off a firestorm that has now burned for years.So it should be no surprise that Native Americans feel the reverberations when teams’ stereotypical imagery appears on the biggest stages.“There are now dozens of studies showing the adverse effects for native people,” Fryberg said. “There are certainly no psychological benefits at all. Instead, we are left with harm. Depression, suicide ideation and lowered self-esteem.”If you watch the game on Friday, ask yourself this: Why should racist imagery be more important than ending a long cycle of humiliating our most marginalized citizens?It’s 2021, and time for change."
93,Roger Goodell’s Pay for Two Years Reached Nearly $128 Million,"The N.F.L. commissioner’s compensation for 2019-20 and 2020-21, bolstered by bonuses for closing labor and media rights deals, was disclosed to team owners in a private meeting.",,"N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell’s pay for the past two fiscal years totaled almost $128 million, bolstered by bonuses for helping the league’s owners clinch a new 10-year labor deal with the players and secure media contracts worth more than $100 billion over the next decade.The nine-figure combination of salary, bonuses and other benefits made Goodell one of the highest-paid executives in the country, and the disclosure of the deal comes at a time when he has been criticized for his handling of numerous thorny issues, including the investigation into widespread workplace harassment at the Washington Football Team.Goodell’s compensation was discussed at a two-day meeting of the league’s owners in Manhattan this week. During a session on Wednesday when only team owners were in attendance, a slide was shown listing the commissioner’s pay: $63,900,050 per year, or just under $128 million for the fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21.The N.F.L.’s calendar year begins in mid-March, and Goodell’s pay each year is determined by several prominent committees made up of owners of the league’s 32 clubs.The owners on Wednesday were told that Goodell’s recent pay package, about 90 percent of which is bonuses, was so large because he had helped secure such favorable labor and media deals, according to four people who attended the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was a private session among about two dozen team owners.The N.F.L. declined to comment.In the past, the compensation committee recommended a figure that went to the full ownership for approval. But after a dispute between the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and the half-dozen team owners who made up the compensation committee, Goodell’s contract was restructured to rely heavily on performance-based bonuses instead of guaranteed salaries.In 2017 Goodell signed a five-year deal that took effect in 2019 and is worth up to $200 million in total, much of it tied to his meeting financial and nonfinancial goals for the league. The owners on three influential committees, which have a total of about 20 members, decide annually whether the commissioner has met the targets.The labor deal, which the players narrowly agreed to pass just as the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020, added a 17th regular season game to the calendar. The stability guaranteed by a new collective bargaining agreement also helped the N.F.L. negotiate far larger television contracts with CBS, Fox, NBC and other outlets. Goodell also steered the league through the pandemic, with no games canceled during the 2020 season.While Goodell is often criticized by the news media, fans, politicians and supporters of women’s rights, the league’s owners by and large support him, even as they quietly acknowledge that he is hardly the perfect leader for North America’s most successful professional sports league.His tenure as commissioner, which began in 2006, has been punctuated by controversies and self-inflicted problems, including his handling of cases involving domestic violence, bullying and players’ protesting police brutality and inequality during the national anthem.Goodell has also angered teams that he has penalized, most notably when he suspended star players like Tom Brady and Ezekiel Elliott. But owners understand that Goodell’s strengths help make them money, and that his institutional knowledge would be hard to replace.Several owners said in 2017 that Goodell had told them that he would step down after his current contract ends in 2024. He may be willing to stay beyond that date, according to some media reports.Goodell, 62, has worked at the league for nearly four decades, and has known and is known by many owners, their ancestors and their progeny. He is friendly with the leaders of the league’s broadcast partners, whose rights payments make up about half of the N.F.L.’s annual revenue, which has more than doubled since Goodell took over in 2006.In 2010, Goodell said he wanted revenue to hit $25 billion by 2027, and thanks to the new media deals, the league appears on pace to meet that target.For years, Goodell’s compensation, along with that of other top league officials, was included in annual filings that had to be published because the league office (unlike the teams) was a tax-exempt organization. In 2015, the league dropped its decades-old tax-exempt status after critics, including some members of Congress, argued that the government was losing millions of dollars in potential revenue.As a result, the league no longer has to publicly disclose its tax returns, which included the salaries of its five highest-paid executives. Major League Baseball took a similar step several years before the N.F.L. By and large, awkward questions from the news media about the commissioner’s pay package disappeared."
94,"To Save a Swirling Season, Atlanta Turned to Soft Serve",Atlanta has been praised for its shrewd deadline trades. Braves players credit their resurgence to a midseason pickup that produces day after day.,"Published Oct. 28, 2021","To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.ATLANTA — The Atlanta Braves are making their first World Series appearance since 1999 because of star players at several positions, an underrated pitching staff and shrewd midsummer moves by the front office.Inside the clubhouse, though, players also point to a secret weapon. It doesn’t field, throw or hit, but it has delivered over and over again. Atlanta’s game-changer in 2021? A soft-serve ice cream machine.“When they brought that into the clubhouse, it was like magic,” infielder Johan Camargo said. Added the star reliever Tyler Matzek, “It’s just something that we kind of rallied around.”The story of how a frozen treat invigorated a team that was treading water early in the season begins in Boston in late May. Atlanta was visiting Fenway Park when, during a 9-5 loss to the Red Sox, the team endured a rain delay that lasted nearly three hours.“We didn’t restart the game until midnight,” Matzek said. “There was nobody in the stands. It was absolutely pouring. We were like, ‘Oh, well, there’s nothing to do, so let’s eat ice cream.’”The pantry in the visitor’s clubhouse at Fenway has a soft-serve ice cream machine. For reliever Josh Tomlin, it brought back memories of trips to Dairy Queen with his father while growing up in Texas.“It was perfect,” he said. “It had a little chocolate side and had a vanilla side, and a swirl in the middle.”The 162-game baseball season, not including the playoffs, is arduously long. Players often look for small pleasures to break up the monotony: drinks on the team plane, a silly song to rally around, even a rare home-cooked meal. And who doesn’t like ice cream?So soon after returning to Atlanta, Matzek said he and his teammates began teasing Calvin Minasian, who oversees the clubhouse at Truist Park, that his Boston counterpart was better at his job. Why hadn’t Minasian, they needled, sourced them a soft-serve ice cream machine?Minasian knew he couldn’t order such a device without permission. Tomlin, 37, said the players talked things over and tasked the star first baseman Freddie Freeman, 32, the team’s longtime leader and reigning 2020 National League Most Valuable Player, with taking their case to General Manager Alex Anthopoulos.Anthopoulos said his first reaction was a joking reluctance to go along. “We’re going to have all these guys crushing ice cream and, oh man, they’re all going to be 400 pounds,” he said he told himself. But when Anthopoulos saw the players weren’t kidding, he approved his first purchase of an ice cream machine in his 10 years as a G.M.“I view this relationship as a partnership,” Anthopoulos said. “We’re not anyone’s parents. So I can joke about stuff like that but these guys are grown men. They’re responsible. Freddie, especially, takes tremendous care of himself. But it’s something they really wanted. And it’s a two-way street, right? We ask these guys as a club for stuff all the time: ‘Can you help us out with this?’ or ‘Can you help us out with that?’”The requests can range from participating in charity and marketing events to helping vet potential roster additions. A week before Atlanta traded for Cleveland outfielder Eddie Rosario, for example, Anthopoulos called the infielder Ehire Adrianza, a former teammate of Rosario’s in Minnesota, for his perspective. Rosario has since blossomed into an October star.“If they feel strongly about something, within reason obviously, then sure,” Anthopoulos said, though he joked that “if they said, ‘Hey, we want five ice cream machines, a cotton candy machine and we want this and that,’ of course no.”The players said they understood the boundaries.“Everyone thinks that we eat chicken breast and vegetables every single second of the day,” Matzek said. “I mean, we do. We’ve got to take care of our bodies. But everybody loves ice cream.”The machine arrived during the second week of June, when the team was a season-low five games under .500. When Anthopoulos finally saw it, he snapped a photo and texted it to Freeman, who replied, “2-0!!!” The team, Freeman was saying, had won consecutive games since the machine had been turned on.The banter between the G.M. and star soon turned into a running joke. “We’ll be a softball team soon enough,” Anthopoulos messaged at one point. “Anything to win the East!!!” Freeman replied, referring to the team’s division.A few days later, Freeman texted Anthopoulos to tell him they were now 3-1 with the ice cream. He also sent a photo of himself enjoying a cup of it. Anthopoulos later joked to Freeman that he would get a machine installed in Freeman’s house if the team won its division.“If you told me I had to spend my own money to buy an ice cream machine to win the N.L. East, I would do it,” Anthopoulos said.On Sept. 30, Atlanta claimed its fourth straight division title, overcoming injuries to star players such as outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. and capping a 56-37 stretch fueled, at least in part, by hard-hit balls and soft-serve pulls. Freeman, too, started the season slowly but finished with a .300 average and 31 home runs after a summer tear that also coincided with the arrival of a certain dessert.(Freeman has so far declined to collect on Anthopoulos’s offer of a personal machine for two reasons: “I watch how much the chefs in the clubhouse clean it and I’m like, ‘I’m good, man’” and “I don’t need my son just pulling down for ice cream.”)Now a beloved clubhouse fixture, the machine has been at the heart of a season full of good memories. Freeman’s oldest son Charlie, 5, and Tomlin have a tradition that started soon after it arrived: After every home victory, Tomlin gives Charlie a small cup of ice cream with sprinkles, from which Charlie takes only one bite. The children of several other players also come into the clubhouse after home wins to enjoy the same treat.Before every home game, Camargo, 27, said he serves himself a little “to get a taste.” Matzek, another standout this postseason, loves making root beer floats. Everyone has enjoyed the ice cream, even Anthopoulos and his son, and, of course, Freeman.“You see Freddie over there, sitting cross legged at his locker before a game and he’s munching on an ice cream cone, and it’s funny,” Tomlin said. “That dude is one of the best baseball players in the world and he’s over there eating an ice cream cone.”Although the Braves’ machine has only one flavor (vanilla), Tomlin commended Minasian for building a sundae bar: chocolate and caramel sauces, sprinkles and small plastic bowls shaped like helmets.“It’s just a cool little something to get your mind off something else,” he said. “Just go in there and get your ice cream cone and you’re a kid again.”The legend of the machine grew as the team turned its season around. The Braves didn’t look like a playoff contender when the soft serve arrived and now they’re in the World Series. Said Matzek, “I just know that we got an ice cream machine and we started playing better.”“You need good players, obviously,” Anthopoulos said, “but I do think you should have an environment that people are happy to come to work every day, whether you’re a baseball player or an executive in an office.”With three more wins against Houston, Atlanta would celebrate its first title since 1995. If that happens, the Champagne, beer and, yes, the soft serve will be flowing."
95,"The Astros, and Their Star Player, Get Back on Track","Jose Altuve broke out of a slump, setting the tone in a crucial Game 2 win that tied the World Series as it heads to Atlanta.","Published Oct. 28, 2021","[Follow our live Astros vs Braves score and coverage.]HOUSTON — When Jose Altuve stepped to the plate to start the bottom of the first inning in Game 2 of the World Series on Wednesday night, he was 3 for 29 since the start of the American League Championship Series. That included an 0-for-5 performance in the World Series opener against Atlanta on Tuesday.There was no hiding the ugliness, not that Altuve would have tried. As the leadoff hitter for a Houston Astros franchise stained by its 2017-2018 cheating scandal, Altuve has learned this season, with fans back in stadiums, that he cannot hide. He has been the primary target of rival fans all year. He can do nothing but keep his head down, take it and keep plowing forward.So when he plastered a Max Fried fastball into left field for a double in Game 2, and followed that by sending a Drew Smyly fastball over the left-field wall in the seventh inning to punctuate Houston’s 7-2 series-evening win, it was as if the Astros were welcoming back an old friend.“That’s what professionals do,” Houston manager Dusty Baker said. “When you know you can play, you have to. I mean, you have no choice.“My dad used to tell me it’s OK to get down. Just don’t stay down. So he didn’t stay down.”This is Altuve’s sixth postseason, and his third World Series. He is a former winner of the A.L. Most Valuable Player Award (2017) and a seven-time All-Star. He has been an A.L.C.S. M.V.P. (2019) and he has won three batting titles. Altuve knows how to do this.So when he did regain his balance, it might put his team more at ease than himself.“He sets a really good example as a teammate,” Houston’s starting pitcher, Jose Urquidy, said through the translator Andrew Dunn-Bauman. “Even when he speaks to us or just watching him play, he sets a really good example and he transmits really great energy and leadership to the team.“So we just try to absorb as much of that as we can from him.”Altuve, 31, has been doing this long enough now at this time of year that the seventh-inning homer, his 22nd in the postseason, tied the former Yankee Bernie Williams for second-most in major league history. Only Manny Ramirez (29) has hit more.“Great hitter, obviously,” Altuve said of Williams. “To hit 22 homers in the playoffs and tie him, always, every time my name is mentioned next to — before it was Derek Jeter, now it is Bernie Williams — it means a lot to me. It makes me keep going out there, hitting homers to help my team, to keep accomplishing things like this.“As long as we win, everything’s good.”The Astros certainly do their share of winning, even if their only World Series triumph remains the tarnished one from 2017. In tying the series at 1-1 as it swings to Atlanta for Game 3 on Friday night, the Astros remain in prime position to add another trophy to their display case.It was a beautiful night in Houston after a vicious thunderstorm accompanied by a tornado warning blew through town Wednesday morning. By the time Altuve banged his leadoff double in the first, it was 73 degrees and the roof at Minute Maid Park was open. The last time that happened in the postseason was in Games 3 and 4 in the 2005 World Series against the Chicago White Sox.The Astros prefer the roof closed because doing so amplifies the noise its fans generate. But this time, they acquiesced to M.L.B.’s request.It was different. It was pleasant. And for Altuve and the Astros, it worked.“We didn’t want to go to Atlanta down by two,” he said. “So we left everything we had in there tonight.”On a podium for their news conference, Altuve’s teammate, Jose Siri, made a show of removing two gaudy rings and placing them on Altuve’s fingers as the two Astros laughed.When someone asked what was up, Altuve grinned and said, “He’s just giving me his ring so I can flash, a little flash, bling.”His evening started with a flash at the plate and ended that way, too. Finally, things felt mostly back to normal in Houston."
96,"Atlanta Heads Home, Hoping to Find Strength in Defiance","A region’s fans have their share of enemies, real or imagined, and the atmosphere at their World Series games should be electric.","Published Oct. 28, 2021","HOUSTON — The Atlanta Braves have not won a home game in the World Series since the night they clinched a championship in 1995. That was three stadiums ago, before Turner Field (a repurposed Olympics venue) and their more recent move to Cobb County.“The atmosphere is awesome,” said Brian Snitker, Atlanta’s manager, as the World Series shifted to Georgia after Wednesday’s 7-2 loss to the Houston Astros. “Braves Country is real. It’s real.”The local fans will have many reasons to rock the Battery, the hive of new apartments, stores and restaurants surrounding five-year-old Truist Park, at Game 3 on Friday night. The World Series — tied one game apiece — has not been to town since 1999, and that’s reason enough to celebrate. But there’s more.You can understand if the fans in Atlanta bring an edge to the game. The Astros are largely reviled beyond Houston for illegally stealing signs during their 2017 championship run. They make for an easy villain.Another villain, from the point of view of Atlanta’s fans, is Major League Baseball, for pulling this summer’s All-Star Game from Truist Park to protest restrictive new voting laws in Georgia. A third villain is just about everyone else — or, at least, all those folks who want the fans to stop doing the tomahawk chop after 30 years, and want the franchise to change its name, too.There is precedent for that, after Washington’s football team and Cleveland’s baseball team dropped their long-standing Native American nicknames. But the Braves are not budging, M.L.B. is not pushing — and there may just be no realistic way to stop thousands of fans from chanting and chopping in unison. Shaming won’t do it.Beyond all that, former President Donald J. Trump is expected to attend Game 4 on Saturday night. Trump last took in the World Series two years ago in Washington, when he was shown on the scoreboard and booed by the fans in attendance. Another N.L. East ballpark may be more forgiving.Whatever happens, this will be a showcase for Atlanta fans, a chance to climb onto the national stage no matter what the rest of the country thinks. The team made a spirited comeback to win the National League East, then ripped through the Milwaukee Brewers and the Los Angeles Dodgers, going undefeated in five home playoff games.The fans have already taken to the us-against-the-world theme. During the N.L. Championship Series, a Los Angeles Times columnist compared Truist Park to a sterile shopping mall, and tweeted that the fans were mostly interested in a postgame trip to the Waffle House.The team responded by serving Waffle House in the press box last week. Current and former Braves have endorsed the Georgia-based chain as something of a rallying cry on Twitter, and “Sterile Shopping Mall” T-shirts have shown up in Atlanta’s dugout.“I know they’re going to bring it,” starter Max Fried said of the Atlanta crowd. “We’ve got some really great fans, and I know that they’ll be ready.”Here’s the problem: the Astros will be ready, too. In their five-year playoff streak — all with a core infield of Jose Altuve, Alex Bregman, Carlos Correa and Yuli Gurriel — the Astros have gone 15-13 in opponent’s ballparks, with victories in Boston, Los Angeles, Cleveland, New York, Washington, Minnesota and Chicago.Most significantly, the last time the Astros traveled after Game 2 of the World Series, they won three in a row at Nationals Park in 2019, spoiling Washington’s first time hosting the World Series in 86 years. If they have the same kind of road trip to Atlanta, the Astros will come home with a championship trophy.“We are very focused on winning,” said starter Jose Urquidy after beating the Braves on Wednesday, “and finish the series over there.”As joyously defiant as four decks of fans may be, the Astros will probably shrug. No team has been jeered as lustily (or as deservedly) as the Astros lately, and they just keep winning. They are the last team that would be intimidated.“Nothing is easy in baseball, especially playoffs, but when you’ve been in situations before, you know how to handle it,” said Altuve, whose homer at frenzied Fenway Park turned around the American League Championship Series in Game 4.“So I know what my team is capable to do to win three in a row, to come back from things that we don’t want, the situations we wouldn’t want to be in. But we overcome those situations.”Altuve’s homer in Boston came on the first pitch of the eighth inning; on Wednesday against Atlanta, he connected on the first pitch of the bottom of the seventh. Ian Anderson, the Braves’ rookie starter, would be wise to remember that if Altuve leads off, as expected, on Friday night.“If I’m doing good, I want to swing,” Altuve said. “If I’m doing bad, I want to swing because it might be the only pitch I get. So it’s not a secret that I like swinging.”It’s also not a secret that home-field advantage has been meaningless in recent World Series. No team has clinched in its home ballpark in eight years. The Astros won Game 7 at Dodger Stadium in 2017, and lost Game 7 at home two years later to Washington.“You kind of thrive on the animosity from the crowd,” said the former National Max Scherzer, who started that seventh game in Houston. “It’s kind of fun to pitch on the road and everybody’s just screaming. You just have that road warrior mentality.”The visitors from Houston have it. The fans in Atlanta will demand to be heard, but that might be just how the Astros want it."
97,"Astros Dink and Dunk Their Way to a Win, Tying Series","A series of light hits and defensive miscues let Houston run up the score early, and the Astros’ pitching held the lead.","Published Oct. 27, 2021","HOUSTON — It had been nearly four years since the Houston Astros enjoyed the taste of victory in a World Series game at Minute Maid Park, an almost inexplicable stretch of five straight losses at home in the Fall Classic.Home is supposed to be where sports teams flourish, where visiting teams often crumble beneath the noisy inhospitality of the local fans breathing hot venom on their necks. But the last time the Astros won at home in the World Series was Game 5 of the 2017 World Series, when Houston beat the Los Angeles Dodgers on its way to its only championship.After that they lost five World Series games in a row, including all four during the 2019 series loss to the Washington Nationals, and then Game 1 against Atlanta on Tuesday.But the streak finally ended on Wednesday as Houston beat Atlanta, 7-2, in Game 2 at Minute Maid Park, giving the Astros’ their first win at home in the World Series since Oct. 29, 2017.The Astros also became the first team to win a World Series game in their home ballpark since the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Boston Red Sox in Game 3 in 2018, meaning the traveling team had won 10 straight. (The 2020 World Series was held at a neutral site in Arlington, Texas, so that did not count).Houston won 51 games at home during the regular season, the third most in the American League, and went 4-1 in the first two rounds of the playoffs, demonstrating that they can win big games at home. But something had been different about the World Series, lately.“Nothing is guaranteed,” said Jose Altuve, Houston’s star second baseman who homered in the win. “Yeah, we lost four games here in ’19 in a row. We lost yesterday. But we came back tonight and won.”It was no masterpiece, though. The game was ragged and became lopsided so quickly that much of the tension and interest was lost by the second inning. As with Game 1, it will not be recalled as a memorable World Series game.Houston took advantage of sloppy play by Atlanta, and some luck, too, especially during a wacky second inning, in which eight batters came to the plate and four of them scored on a collection of lightly hit but well-placed balls that frustrated Atlanta starter Max Fried.He did not pitch poorly, as evinced by the fact that Atlanta Manager Brian Snitker never had a relief pitcher warming up during the inning. He could see that the Astros were not bashing balls to the far reaches of the park. It was more that they kept finding holes in the defense, and Atlanta left fielder Eddie Rosario made a throwing error.Fried surrendered five earned runs in five innings, but Snitker said he could not describe it as struggling.“Balls that found holes, checked swings, we threw a ball away,” Snitker said. “It was just a weird inning.”Fried set down the next 10 batters he faced, and was finally lifted in the sixth inning after he issued a walk to Yordan Alvarez and a single to Carlos Correa. Atlanta committed another error in the sixth, by Albies, as Houston extended its lead, 6-2. Altuve’s bases-empty home run in the seventh extended the lead, and it was his 22nd postseason home run. That tied him with Bernie Williams of the Yankees for second on the career list, behind Manny Ramirez’s 29 for Cleveland, Boston and the Dodgers.Jose Urquidy earned the win, allowing two runs and six hits in five innings, and became the first pitcher born in Mexico to win two World Series games. He also won Game 4 of the 2019 World Series in Washington.“Somebody told me that I was the first Mexican to get two wins in a World Series,” he said. “I’m very proud of that.”The Series now shifts to Atlanta for the next three games, beginning on Friday, which is why Altuve called Game 2 a “must-win” affair. Atlanta has won nine straight postseason games at home. And the last 12 teams that have fallen behind, two games to none, in the World Series, all went on to lose the series.But even before Game 2 started, Baker was not inclined to panic, not with this team. Houston had fallen behind, two games to one, to the Boston Red Sox in the American League Championship Series, and came back to win the next three games.Baker said on Tuesday that after that Game 3 in Boston, he received text messages of support from friends, some tinged with desperation, as if the Astros faced an insurmountable deficit.“It’s like, dude, this is a seven-game series,” Baker said of his response to those messages. “It ain’t no one-game series. If it was a one-game series, I mean, you can save all of us sleepless nights, and just go home now.”But the Astros already were at home when he said it, and for the first time in six World Series tries, they actually won there."
98,Cleveland Roller Derby Team Sues City’s Baseball Team Over ‘Guardians’ Name,"“To be blunt, Plaintiff was here first,” the Cleveland Guardians roller derby team said in filing a suit claiming trademark infringement.","Published Oct. 27, 2021","Is Cleveland big enough for two sports teams named the Guardians? A roller derby team that has used the name since 2013 says no.The roller derby Cleveland Guardians sued the city’s Major League Baseball team in federal court on Wednesday in an effort to block the baseball team from changing its name to the Cleveland Guardians, contending that the change infringes on the roller derby team’s trademark rights.The baseball team announced in July that it was changing its name from the Indians to the Guardians after years of pressure to veer away from a team name that many considered racist toward Indigenous people.The coed roller derby team, which operates in the Cleveland suburb of Parma, Ohio, has been called the Guardians since 2013 and formally registered the name “Cleveland Guardians” with the Ohio secretary of state in 2017, according to its lawsuit filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.In the lawsuit, Guardians Roller Derby v. Cleveland Guardians Baseball Company L.L.C., the roller derby team claims that the M.L.B. team knew the Guardians existed months before the name change was announced.“A Major League club cannot simply take a smaller team’s name and use it for itself,” the lawsuit says. “Economic might, however, does not make legal right. There cannot be two ‘Cleveland Guardians’ teams in Cleveland, and, to be blunt, Plaintiff was here first.”The lawsuit also claims the M.L.B. team filed its trademark application in Mauritius, a small East African island nation, and that in doing so the baseball team was “effectively hiding the application unless one knew where to look.”The baseball team said in a statement on Wednesday that it was in the right.“We have been and continue to be confident in our position to become the Guardians,” the baseball team said. “We believe there is no conflict between the parties and their ability to operate in their respective business areas.”Two months after the baseball team filed its trademark application, it contacted the roller derby team to inform it of the name change, according to the lawsuit. As the two teams corresponded, Gary Sweatt, the owner of Guardians Roller Derby, offered to sell the rights to his team’s names, including the website, and invited the M.L.B. team to make an offer.In June, the M.L.B. team offered to pay “a nominal amount,” the lawsuit said. Mr. Sweatt rejected the offer and countered with another proposal, which the baseball team did not address, according to the lawsuit. In July, the baseball team announced its name change with a theatrical video posted online that was narrated by Tom Hanks.When the baseball team announced the name change, the team said it would finish the 2021 season as the Indians and would “look to launch as the Cleveland Guardians at the conclusion of the season.”In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Sweatt, the owner of Guardians Roller Derby, said the team believes it is “in the right.”“Just like our athletes do on the track, we will put everything into this effort at the courthouse,” he said.The roller derby team is a nonprofit organization, and any profits made from Cleveland Guardians merchandise are used to provide “funding for training its skaters and for hosting community events,” the lawsuit said.As of Wednesday night, the ClevelandGuardians.com website still displayed the roller derby team’s content, as did Facebook.com/clevelandguardians. The baseball team still uses Indians.com as its website and the Twitter handle @indians.In the lawsuit, the roller derby team said it was “inconceivable that an organization worth more than $1B and estimated to have annual revenues of $290M+ would not have at least performed a Google search for ‘Cleveland Guardians’ before settling on the name.”In a statement, Christopher Pardo, the lead lawyer for the roller derby team, said the baseball team “knowingly and willfully eviscerated the rights of the original owner of that name — the real Cleveland Guardians.”“Major League Baseball would never let someone name their lacrosse team the ‘Chicago Cubs’ if the team was in Chicago, or their soccer team the ‘New York Yankees’ if that team was in New York — nor should they,” Mr. Pardo said. “The same laws that protect Major League Baseball from the brand confusion that would occur in those examples also operate in reverse to prevent what the Indians are trying to do here.”"
